       "array([[b'A 21-gun salute is the most commonly recognized of the customary gun salutes that are performed by the firing of cannons or artillery as a military honor.\\nThe custom stems from naval tradition, where a warship would fire its cannons harmlessly out to sea, until all ammunition was spent, to show that it was disarmed, signifying the lack of hostile intent. As naval customs evolved, 21 guns came to be fired for heads of state, or in exceptional circumstances for head of government, with the number decreasing with the rank of the recipient of the honor.\\nWhile the 21-gun salute is the most commonly recognized, the number of rounds fired in any given salute will vary depending on the conditions. Circumstances affecting these variations include the particular occasion and, in the case of military and state funerals, the branch of service, and rank (or office) of the person to whom honors are being rendered.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe tradition of saluting can be traced to the Late Middle Ages practice of placing oneself in an unarmed position and, therefore, in the power of those being honored. This may be noted in the dropping of the point of the sword, presenting arms, discharging cannon and small arms by firing them, lowering sails, manning the yards, removing the headdress or laying on oars.\\n\\nThe gun salute might have originated in the 17th century with the maritime practice of demanding that a defeated enemy expend its ammunition and render itself helpless until reloaded, a time-consuming operation. The gun salute had been established as a naval tradition by the late sixteenth century. A man-of-war which visited a foreign port would discharge all its guns to show that its guns were empty. Since the ship would not have enough time to reload before it was within range of the shore batteries, it was clearly demonstrating its friendly intentions by going in with empty guns.\\nSalute by gunfire is an ancient ceremony. For years, the British compelled weaker nations to render the first salute; but in time, international practice compelled \"gun for gun\" on the principle of equality of nations. In the earliest days, seven guns was the recognized British national salute because seven was the standard number of weapons on a vessel. In that day, gunpowder made from sodium nitrate was easier to keep on dry land than at sea. Thus those early regulations stated that although a ship would fire only seven guns, the forts ashore would fire three shots to each one shot afloat, hence the number 21.\\nThe system of firing an odd number of rounds is said to have been originated by Samuel Pepys, Secretary to the Navy in the Restoration, as a way of economizing on the use of powder, the rule until that time having been that all guns had to be fired. Odd numbers were chosen, as even numbers indicated a death. With the increase in quality of naval gunpowder by the use of potassium nitrate, honours rendered at sea were increased to the shore salute. 21 guns became the highest national honor.\\nThere was much confusion because of the varying customs of maritime states, but finally the British government proposed to the United States a regulation that provided for \"salutes to be returned gun for gun\". The British at that time officially considered the international salute to sovereign states to be 21 guns, and the United States adopted the 21 guns and \"gun for gun\" return on 18 August 1875.\\n\\n\\n== By country ==\\n\\n\\n=== Bangladesh ===\\nThe 21-gun salute in Bangladesh is generally used for:\\nMartyrs (a member of the armed forces or other services or a civilian who is killed in any action or however is honored as a martyr)\\nOpening the Victory Day parade show on 16 December and the Independence Day celebration on 26 March.\\nOccasions that happen to be largely associated with any national achievements or celebrations.\\n\\n\\n=== Canada ===\\nGun salutes are used at special holidays, state funerals, and for members of the Canadian Royal Family.\\n21-gun salutes are used for these people and holidays:\\nThe sovereign\\nThe Governor General of Canada (installation, special events, departure)\\nForeign heads of state\\nMembers of foreign reigning royal families\\nThe monarch\\'s official birthday (Monday prior to 25 May, in each provincial capital as well as the national capital)\\nCanada Day (1 July, in each provincial capital as well as the national capital)\\nRemembrance Day (however the proper rate of fire for this \"Funeral Salute\" is one round per minute rather than the normal one round every seven seconds) - the historically correct practice of firing the \"Funeral Salute\" at one minute intervals was revived by The Seymour Artillery Company at Port Moody, BC, in 2007 and has been adopted at other sites since that date, (11 November, in many locations in Canada including provincial capitals, Ottawa, and Montreal)\\nBirth of a member of the Royal Family\\nThe prime minister, heads of foreign missions, foreign heads of government, and the Vice President of the United States are entitled to a 19 gun salute.\\nA 17-gun salute is given to the Canadian Minister of National Defence when visiting a saluting station (limited to once a year), as well as foreign ministers of defence.\\nA 15-gun salute is given on certain occasions for the lieutenant governors of the provinces, such as the Speech from the Throne in a provincial legislature, or for special occasions such as state funerals of important persons.\\nBefore they were abolished in 1968 by the Trudeau government, royal salutes used to be fired in Ottawa, the provincial capitals, and Montreal and Vancouver also on the Queen\\'s Accession Day (February 6), the Queen\\'s actual birthday (April 21), the Queen\\'s Coronation Day (June 2), the Birthday of the Duke of Edinburgh (June 10), and the Birthday of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (August 4).\\n\\n\\n=== Republic of China (Taiwan) ===\\nThe 21-gun salute is used in the Republic of China in honor of the President during National Day celebrations. After military band trumpeters sound the attention call, the audience is asked to stand up as the President enters. After she or he stands in the podium, the gun salute starts while the gun salute music is played. In some celebrations, it is done while the National Anthem is played, preceded by four ruffles and flourishes..\\n\\n\\n=== Czech Republic ===\\nThis cannonade salute is used in relation to Czech presidential events and for the inauguration of the Prague Castle guard. It is fired to the sound of the National Anthem. The cannons used today were modified in 1993 from decommissioned 85mm vz.52 artillery cannons with electronic firing mechanisms by the Czech Military Technical Institute of arms and ammunition in Slavi\\xc4\\x8d\\xc3\\xadn. The ammunition used is a version of blank shells, modified for an increased acoustic effect. Shots are traditionally fired from either two or four cannons so that, in the case of a failure of one of the weapons, the others will substitute it.\\nThe salute was given to the ex-president V\\xc3\\xa1clav Havel by an artillery battery of four cannons (each firing 21 times) from the Pet\\xc5\\x99\\xc3\\xadn hill on the 23 December 2011 during the commemorative service after his death.\\n\\n\\n=== Denmark ===\\n\\nGun salutes are used for a variety of occasions, mostly in honor of the Danish Royal Family. There are permanent salutory guns in place at Kronborg Castle in Elsinore, the Sixtus battery at Holmen naval base in Copenhagen, as well as at the naval base at Kangilinnguit in Greenland.\\nA 27-gun salute is used in honor of Majesties, whereas the 21-gun salute is used in honor of other members of the Danish Royal Family.\\nGun salutes occur on:\\n16 April - Birthday of HM the Queen\\n11 June - Birthday of HRH the Prince Consort\\nAt the occasion of royal births\\nAt the occasion of royal funerals\\nGun salutes also occur during naval visits and when a foreign head of state arrives on a state visit. Also, when HM the Queen heads out on her annual summer cruise on the Royal Yacht Dannebrog, she is saluted when passing Kronborg.\\nThe day after the birth of Princess Benedikte in 1944 which took place during Nazi Germany\\'s Occupation of Denmark, members of the Danish resistance group Holger Danske performed a salute of 21 bombs in the \\xc3\\x98rstedsparken public park in central Copenhagen as a reference to the traditional 21-gun salute performed at the occasion of royal births.\\n\\n\\n=== France ===\\n\\nThe 21-gun is accorded to the President of the French Republic, forming part of his \"military honors\" (honneurs militaires). The salute is given during the inauguration ceremony (by two 75mm guns) and during naval visits. These honors are extended to foreign heads of state when in State visit.\\nAll French Navy vessels anchored in a French harbor on Bastille Day must issue a 21-gun salute at noon, subjected to local regulation.\\n\\n\\n=== India ===\\nThe 21-gun salute is accorded to the President of India on several occasions. As soon as a new President is sworn in, a 21-gun salute is given. On Republic Day of India, every year, a 21-gun salute is given to the National Flag and the President, during the Flag Hoisting Ceremony. When a foreign head of State or head of government visits India, a formal reception is held at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, and the head of state is given a 21-gun salute, with a 19-gun salute given to a foreign head of government.\\nDuring the British Raj, India developed a formal hierarchical system of gun salutes. At the time of Indian independence in 1947, the hierarchy of salutes within British India stood as follows:\\nPrior to Indian independence in 1947, the Viceroy of India received a unique viceregal salute of 31 guns. After 1947, the 31-gun salute was retained for honouring the Governor-General of India (1947-1950), and for the President of India from 1950 until 1971, as several former Indian salute-state princes enjoyed 21-gun salutes even after independence. The 31-gun salute was used upon the inaugurations and official arrivals of Presidents of India, and was finally replaced with the 21-gun salute in 1971, when the former salute-state princes\\' privilege of receiving gun salutes was revoked.\\nThe more important of the hundreds of vassal rulers of princely states involved in indirect rule were classified by the number of guns used when paying honours to them, signifying their prestige in the eyes of the British. The highest of these so-called \"salute states\" (also in some other parts of the British Empire) enjoyed 21 guns.\\nDuring British colonial rule in India, the heads of the following states received 21-gun salutes:\\nHyderabad\\nMysore\\nJammu and Kashmir\\nBaroda\\nGwalior\\nThe heads of the following states received 19-gun salutes:\\nBhopal (21 local)\\nIndore (21 local)\\nUdaipur (21 local)\\nKolhapur\\nTravancore\\nKalat\\nThe heads of the following states had 17-gun salutes:\\nBharatpur (19 local)\\nBikaner (19 local)\\nCutch (19 local)\\nJaipur/Amber (19 local)\\nJodhpur/Marwar (19 local)\\nPatiala (19 local)\\nTonk\\nBundi\\nBahawalpur\\nKotah\\nCochin\\nKarauli\\nRewa\\n\\n\\n=== Indonesia ===\\nIn Indonesia, the 21-gun salute is executed during the commemoration of the seconds of proclamation of the independence of Indonesia on every 17th of august at 10 am near the Merdeka Palace at Jakarta. It is also done in other cities in Indonesia during the independence day commemoration ceremonies. The 21-gun salute is also sometimes done during the state-visit of foreign state leaders in Indonesia. The responsibility of this activity is done by the Artillery units from the Indonesian Army and sometimes from the Indonesian Marine Corps Artillery regiments.\\nSee the 21-gun salute in Indonesia here: Indonesian Independence Day 21-gun salute\\n\\n\\n=== Israel ===\\nIn Israel the practice of gun salute has been eliminated since Israel has suffered many terror attacks and thus the firing of arms has a negative connotation. The three-volley salute is still used in military funerals.\\n\\n\\n=== Philippines ===\\nThe 21-gun salute is used in events, such as the inauguration of the President, death of a top military official, death of a former president or courtesy calls of foreign leaders during their state visits. The practice is heavily influenced by the United States of America.\\nGun salutes can occur on:\\n30 June - The official date of Inaugurations\\nSelected day in March - Graduation Parade of the Philippine Military Academy\\n23 March - Army Day\\n9 April - Araw ng Kagitingan (Day of Valor)\\n20 May - Navy Day\\n12 June - Independence Day\\n1 July - Air Force Day\\n21 December - Founding of the Armed Forces of the Philippines(Armed Forces Day)\\nOn the occasions of service change of command ceremonies and ceremonial parades\\nOn these days, the 21-gun salute is done by either the Philippine Army or the Philippine Marine Corps.\\nThe three-volley gun salute can also occur in the death of the low ranking military officials and soldiers who died heroically in combat while the 21-guns are reserved upon news of the deaths of national leaders. The normal 21-gun salute is also given to visiting heads of state upon their arrival at Malaca\\xc3\\xb1ang Palace, with the guns manned by the Presidential Security Group.\\nOther salutes include 19 guns for the Vice President of the Philippines, 17 for the Chief of Staff, AFP, service commanders and the Secretary of National Defense. 15 guns are fired for other Cabinet secretaries.\\n\\n\\n=== Poland ===\\nIn Poland the 21-gun salute is used in military funerals and funerals of fallen leaders and heroes. Known as the Salwa Honorowa (Honour Salute), it is also used in national holidays.\\n\\n\\n=== Pakistan ===\\nIn Pakistan a 21-gun salute is used on occasions such as on Pakistan Day (23 March), on which a 21-gun salute is given in provincial capitals and 31 in Islamabad, the federal capital. It is also given on Independence Day (14 August) and Defence Day (6 September). A 31-gun salute in Islamabad and a 21-gun salute in provincial capitals is also given on 12 Rabi-ul-Awwal the birth date of Prophet Muhammad. It is also given when a foreign president or prime minister visits Pakistan.\\n\\n\\n=== Romania ===\\nSalute with 21 cannons is awarded in honor of the National Day, the National Anthem or Flag, in honor of a sovereign or a foreign head of state.\\n\\n\\n=== Singapore ===\\nA 21-gun salute is carried out for National Day Parades in Singapore by the Singapore Artillery during the presidential inspection of parade contingents.\\nThe 21-gun salute was given to the former prime minister and founding leader Lee Kuan Yew during his state funeral.\\n\\n\\n=== Sweden ===\\n\\n21-gun salutes mark special royal occasions throughout Sweden, referred to as a Kunglig Salut (Royal Salute). The number of rounds fired in a salute depends on the place and occasion. The basic salute is 21 rounds. However, when a birth takes place within the Royal House of Sweden, and the child is the firstborn to either the reigning monarch or to the heir to the throne, an extra 21 rounds (for a total of 42) are added to the normal salute. In all other births 21 rounds are fired.\\nGun salutes occur on:\\n28 January - Name day of HM the King\\n30 April - Birthday of HM the King\\n6 June - National day of Sweden\\n14 July - Birthday of HRH Crown Princess Victoria\\n8 August - Name day of HM the Queen\\n23 December - Birthday of HM the Queen\\nGun salutes also occur at royal weddings, royal births, royal deaths and when a foreign head of state arrives on a state visit in Stockholm.\\nMilitary saluting stations are Skeppsholmen and Kastellholmen in Stockholm, Fortress of Kungshall in Karlskrona, Battery of F\\xc3\\xa5r\\xc3\\xb6sund on the island of Gotland, Boden Fortress in Boden, Battery of Kusth\\xc3\\xb6jden in H\\xc3\\xa4rn\\xc3\\xb6sand, Vaxholm Castle in Vaxholm, Skansen Lejonet Fortress and \\xc3\\x84lvsborg Castle in Gothenburg.\\n19-gun salutes are used for heads of government, cabinet ministers and ambassadors.\\nThe Swedish Armed Forces also use a gun salute consisting of two rapid gunshots. This salute, called Svensk L\\xc3\\xb6sen (Swedish signal), was fired whenever a Swedish ship would enter a harbour in order to identify the ship as Swedish, or on the field of battle to identify the Swedish troops. Sometimes a double signal was fired, i.e. four gunshots fired two and two, hence the Swedish tradition of a fourfold cheer instead of a threefold. This signal is today fired on special occasions, usually within the military.\\n\\n\\n=== United Kingdom ===\\n21-gun salutes mark special royal occasions throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, referred to as a \"Royal Salute\" (in the British Empire it was reserved, mainly among colonial princely states, for the most prestigious category of native rulers of so-called salute states), unless rendered to the president or flag of a republic; nonetheless salutes rendered to all heads of state regardless of title are casually referred to as \"royal\" salutes.\\n\\nThe number of rounds fired in a salute depends on the place and occasion. The basic salute is 21 rounds. In Hyde Park and Green Park an extra 20 rounds are added because they are Royal Parks. At the Tower of London 62 rounds are fired on royal anniversaries (the basic 21, plus a further 20 because the Tower is a Royal Palace and Fortress, plus another 21 \\'for the City of London\\') and 41 on other occasions. The Tower of London probably holds the record for the most rounds fired in a single salute \\xe2\\x80\\x94 124 are fired whenever the Duke of Edinburgh\\'s birthday (62 rounds) coincides with the Saturday designated as the Queen\\'s official birthday (also 62 rounds).\\n\\nGun salutes occur on:\\nAccession Day (6 February)\\nThe Queen\\'s actual birthday (21 April)\\nCoronation Day (the anniversary of The Queen\\'s Coronation, 2 June)\\nThe birthday of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (10 June)\\nThe Queen\\'s official birthday (the first, second, or third Saturday in June)\\nThe birthday of Charles, Prince of Wales (14 November)\\nThe morning of bonfire night to symbolise Guy Fawkes being found under the houses of parliament. (5 November)\\nGun salutes also occur when Parliament is prorogued by the Queen, on royal births and when a visiting head of state meets the Queen in London, Windsor or Edinburgh. A Royal Salute of 21 Guns is fired at Edinburgh Castle in honour of The Queen or Her Personal Representative, the High Commissioner (female) or Lord High Commissioner (male), when processing in state to the Opening of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland which occurs annually in May. The significance of the 21 Gun Salute is that the Lord High Commissioner is representing the Sovereign as Head of State.\\n\\nAuthorized military saluting stations are:\\nin England:\\nHyde Park, London\\nThe Tower of London\\nRoyal Arsenal, Woolwich\\nYork Museum Gardens\\nColchester\\nRoyal Artillery Barracks, Larkhill\\nRoyal Citadel, Plymouth\\nDover Castle\\nFort Blockhouse, Gosport\\nin Scotland:\\nEdinburgh Castle\\nStirling Castle\\nin Wales:\\nCardiff\\nin Northern Ireland:\\nHillsborough Castle\\nSalutes are also fired in Gibraltar.\\nIn London, salutes are fired from Hyde Park and the Tower of London; on State Visits, at the State Opening of Parliament and for Trooping the Colour, Green Park is used instead of Hyde Park. In Hyde Park, the salute is fired by the King\\'s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery. The first round is fired at noon (11am on The Queen\\'s official birthday). At the Tower of London, the salute is fired by the Honourable Artillery Company at 1pm.\\nSalutes in Northern Ireland are usually fired from Hillsborough Castle by 206 (Ulster) Battery, although recently they have also been fired from HMS Caroline in Belfast Harbour.\\n19-gun salutes are used for Field Marshals, ambassadors, and the heads of executive branch of Parliamentary governments (i.e. Prime Ministers).\\nAt 6am annually, in the market town of Lewes, a mortar is fired from the battlements to mark when Guy Fawkes was found and marks the start of Bonfire Night. The mortar is traditionally followed by the sound fire crackers and bangers being let off throughout the town.\\n\\n\\n=== United States ===\\nBeginning in the colonial period, the United States fired one shot for each state in the Union as its national salute.\\nOn 16 November 1776, the West Indian port of St. Eustatius returned a 9-gun salute for the 13-gun salute given by the American brigantine Andrew Doria. At the time, nine guns was the customary salute to an independent republic. This First Salute was specifically ordered by the Dutch governor of the island, and marks the first formal international recognition of the United States as an independent republic. The flag flown by the Andrew Doria was the Grand Union Flag, 13 alternating red and white stripes with the British Flag in the union. The Stars and Stripes received its first salute when John Paul Jones saluted France with 13 guns at Quiberon Bay in 1778 (the Stars and Stripes was not adopted as the national flag until 14 June 1777).\\nThe practice of firing one gun for each state in the union was not officially authorized until 1810, when the United States Department of War declared the number of rounds fired in the \"National Salute\" to be equivalent to the number of states\\xe2\\x80\\x94which, at the time was 17. The tradition continued until 1841 when it was reduced from 26 to 21.\\n\\nIn 1842, the United States declared the 21-gun salute as its \"Presidential Salute\". While the \"National Salute\" had been formally established as the 21-gun salute, the current tradition holds the salute on Independence Day to be a 50 rounds\\xe2\\x80\\x94one round for each state in the union. This \\'Salute to the Nation\\' is fired at noon on 4 July, on U.S. military installations, while the U.S. Navy full-dresses ships and fires 21 guns at noon on 4 July, as well as on Presidents\\' Day.\\nIn April 1914, during the Mexican Revolution, the Tampico Affair occurred, and escalated as a result of a twenty-one gun salute(or more specifically, the lack of one). Nine unarmed American sailors were arrested in Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico, for entering an off-limit area at a fuel loading station. Despite being released, the US Naval commander demanded an apology and a twenty-one gun salute. The apology was provided, but not the salute, giving President Woodrow Wilson reason to order the American occupation of the port of Veracruz. Due to an arms embargo from the United States, issued to try to lessen the bloodshed of the revolution at its border, Mexico was forced to seek arms from European, and to a lesser extent Asian countries. During the occupation, a large German arms shipment aboard the SS Ypiranga was illegally seized, before being released and turned away by the American occupation force. These events ultimately drove a wedge between Mexican-American and German-American relations, and after the start of World War I on 28 July 1914, would cause Germany to seek to influence Mexico into declaring war on the United States, in order to halt American arms shipments to the Allies, and attempt to prevent the then isolationist United States from joining the Allies. This effort ultimately backfired, after culminating in the sending of the Zimmerman Telegram from Germany to Mexico, which urged Mexico to declare war on America, promising support and the return of much of the territory lost during the Mexican-American War, which, after being intercepted, caused America to enter the war on the side of the Allies on 6 April 1917, and due in large part to the arrival of fresh American troops into the war, largely a stalemate in its first years, would lead to the surrender of Germany on 11 November 1918, after helping to overpower the German Army, already fatigued from a long and costly war.\\nOn Memorial Day, batteries on military installations fire a 21-gun salute to the nation\\'s fallen. As well, batteries at Naval stations and on ships, fire a salute of 21-minute guns and display the ensign at half-mast from 8 a.m. until completion of the salute.\\nToday, a 21-gun salute is rendered on the arrival and departure of the President of the United States; it is fired in concordance with four ruffles and flourishes, which are immediately followed by \"Hail to the Chief\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94the actual gun salute begins with the first ruffle and flourish, and \\'run long\\' (i.e. the salute concludes after \"Hail to the Chief\" has ended). A 21-gun salute is also rendered to former U.S. Presidents, foreign Heads of State (or members of a reigning royal family), as well as to Presidents-elect. In such a ceremony, the national anthem of the visiting dignitary\\'s country is played, following the salute.\\nIn accordance with the ceremonial standard operating procedure (SOP) of the 3rd US Infantry (The Old Guard) the various gun salutes are assigned as follows: each round in a given salute is fired one at a time. The number of cannon used in a battery depends upon the intervals between each round fired. This includes, for example, a three-gun battery firing two of its guns with five-second intervals between rounds and one gun remaining at the ready in case of a misfire; such a battery would be used at an Armed Forces Full Honors Funeral, or for State Arrival Ceremony of a foreign dignitary at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery. A four-gun battery has its first three guns firing rounds at three-second intervals, with the fourth gun (again) at the ready in case of misfire.\\nThe SOP also provides each gun salute a two-man gun crew (one loader, one gunner) for each cannon, as well as a five-man \"staff\" of soldiers to give the fire commands. The staff includes an Officer in Charge, a watchman (who marks the intervals and signals each gun to fire), an assistant watchman (as a backup), a counter (who keeps track of the number of rounds fired and signals the last round to the Officer in Charge), and a Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge (who marches the battery into place as well as signals the backup cannon to fire in case another gun misfires).\\nNaval vessels now have saluting guns installed which are used solely for such purpose.\\nNineteen-gun salutes are reserved for the Vice President of the United States, foreign deputy heads of state, cabinet members, Speaker of the House of Representatives, President pro tempore of the Senate, Chief Justice of the United States, state Governors, foreign heads of government (such as Prime Ministers), chiefs of staff and general officers in the U.S. military of five-star rank. For each flag rank junior to a five-star officer, two guns are subtracted (e.g., for a four-star admiral, a 17-gun salute is prescribed; a three-star general would rate a 15-gun salute; a two-star, 13 guns, and a one-star, 11 guns).\\nA gun salute is not to be confused with the three-volley salute often rendered at military funerals.\\nThe gun salutes fired in the United States are as follows:\\n\\n\\n==== Deaths of presidents ====\\n\\nA U.S. presidential death also involves 21-gun salutes and other military traditions. On the day after the death of the president, a former president or president-elect\\xe2\\x80\\x94unless this day falls on a Sunday or holiday, in which case the honor will be rendered the following day\\xe2\\x80\\x94the commanders of Army installations with the necessary personnel and material traditionally order that one gun be fired every half-hour, beginning at reveille and ending at retreat.\\nOn the day of burial, a 21-minute gun salute traditionally is fired starting at noon at all military installations with the necessary personnel and material. Guns will be fired at one-minute intervals. Also on the day of burial, those installations will fire a 50-gun salute\\xe2\\x80\\x94one round for each state\\xe2\\x80\\x94at five-second intervals immediately following lowering of the flag.\\n\\n\\n=== Venezuela ===\\nA 21-gun salute by an artillery battalion from either the Venezuelan Army or the Venezuelan Marine Corps is fired on the folllowing dates:\\nOn the inauguration of a new President\\nState funerals of former Presidents\\n15 January, for the State of the Nation Address\\n24 June, Army Day\\n5 July, Independence Day\\n24 July, Navy Day\\n27 November, Air Force Day\\n\\n\\n== Media ==\\n\\n\\n== Cultural references ==\\nThe title of the Green Day song \"21 Guns\" is a reference to a 21-gun salute.\\nIn the song \"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\" by AC/DC 21-gun salutes are mentioned.\\nThe song \"Move Now\" by Nonpoint also includes a reference.\\nIn the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, when the Grandfather sings \"Posh\" whilst dangling from a hot air balloon, there is a line \"they 21 gun salute me\".\\nBoston-based Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys recorded the song \"21 Guitar Salute\" (originally by The Press) on their 2002 split EP Face to Face vs. Dropkick Murphys.\\nThe 21-gun salute are also mentioned in the song \"Methods to your Madness\" by heavy metal band Metal Church.\\nAnother mention is in the Clutch song \"The Mob Goes Wild\".\\nBritish Grime artist Stormzy included a song titled \"21 Gun Salute\" on his debut album Gang Signs & Prayer.\\nThe 2000 U.S. Open Golf Championship, held at the famed Pebble Beach Golf Links, saw a unique twist on the 21-gun salute.

       "       [b'Emotional abandonment is a subjective emotional state in which people feel undesired, left behind, insecure, or discarded. People experiencing emotional abandonment may feel at loss, cut off from a crucial source of sustenance that has been withdrawn, either suddenly, or through a process of erosion. In a classic abandonment scenario, the severance of the emotional bond is unilateral, that is, it is the object of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attachment that has chosen to break the connection. Feeling rejected, which is a significant component of emotional abandonment, has a biological impact in that it activates the physical pain centers in the brain and can leave an emotional imprint in the brain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s warning system. Abandonment has been a staple of poetry and literature since ancient times.\\n\\n\\n== Separation anxiety ==\\n\\nSeparation anxiety, a substrate of emotional abandonment, is recognized as a primary source of human distress and dysfunction. When we experience a threat to or disconnection in a primary attachment, it triggers a fear response referred to as separation stress or separation anxiety. Separation stress has been the subject of extensive research in psychological and neurobiological fields, and has been shown to be a universal response to separation in the animal world of which human beings are a part. When laboratory rat pups are separated from their mothers for periods of time, researchers measure their distress vocalizations and stress hormones to determine varying conditions of the separation response. As the rats mature, their subsequent reactive behaviors and stress hormones are reexamined and are shown to bear a striking resemblance to the depression, anxiety, avoidance behaviors, and self defeated posturing displayed by human beings known to have suffered earlier separation traumas.\\nOwing to the neocortical component of human functioning, when human beings lose a primary relationship, they grasp its potential repercussions (i.e. they may feel uncertain about the future or fear being unable to climb out of an abyss), thus encumbering an additional layer of separation stress. To abandon is \"to withdraw one\\'s support or help from, especially in spite of duty, allegiance, or responsibility; desert: abandon a friend in trouble.\" When the loss is due to the object\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voluntary withdrawal, a common response is to feel unworthy of love. This indicates the tendency for people to blame the rejection on themselves. \"Am I unworthy of love, destined to grow old and die all alone, bereft of human connection or caring?\" Questioning one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desirability as a mate and fearing eternal isolation are among the additional anxieties incurred in abandonment scenarios. The concurrence of self devaluation and primal fear distinguish abandonment grief from most other types of bereavement. \\n\\n\\n== Psychological trauma ==\\n\\nThe depression of abandonment grief creates a sustained type of stress that constitutes an emotional trauma which can be severe enough to leave an emotional imprint on individuals\\' psychobiological functioning, affecting future choices and responses to rejection, loss, or disconnection. A contributing factor to the trauma-producing event is that \\'being left\\' triggers primal separation fear, also referred to as primal abandonment fear \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the fear of being left with no one to take care of one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vital needs. Our first anxiety is a response to separation from Mother. This sensation is stored in the amygdala \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a structure set deep into the brain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emotional memory system responsible for conditioning the fight/freeze/flight response to fear. Primal fear may have been initiated by birth trauma and even have some prenatal antecedents. The emotional memory system is fairly intact at or before birth and lays down traces of the sensations and feelings of the infant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s separation experiences. These primitive feelings are reawakened by later events, especially those reminiscent of unwanted or abrupt separations from a source of sustenance.\\nIn adulthood, being left arouses primal fear along with other primitive sensations which contribute to feelings of terror and outright panic. Infantile needs and urgencies reemerge and can precipitate a symbiotic regression in which individuals feel, at least momentarily, unable to survive without the lost object. People may also experience the intense stress of helplessness. When they make repeated attempts to compel their loved one to return and are unsuccessful, they feel helpless and inadequate to the task. This helplessness causes people to feel possessed of what Michael Balint calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca limited capacity to perform the work of conquest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the work necessary to transform an indifferent object into a participating partner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d According to Balint, feeling one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98limited capacity\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is traumatic in that it produces a fault line in the psyche which renders the person vulnerable heightened emotional responses within primary relationships.\\nAnother factor contributing to the traumatic conditions is the stress of losing one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s background object. A background object is someone on whom individuals have come to rely in ways they did not realize until the object is no longer present. For instance, the relationship served as a mutual regulatory system. Multiple psychobiological systems helped to maintain individuals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 equilibrium. As members of a couple, they became external regulators for one another. They were attuned on many levels: their pupils dilated in synchrony, they echoed one another\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech patterns, movements, and even cardiac and EEG rhythms. As a couple, they functioned like a mutual bio-feedback system, stimulating and modulating each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bio rhythms, responding to one another\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pheromones, and addicting to the steady trickle of endogenous opiates induced by the relationship. When the relationship ends, the many processes it helped to regulate go into disarray. As the emotional and bio-physiological effects mount, the stressful process is heightened by the knowledge that it was not you, but your loved one who chose withdraw from the bond. This knowledge may cause people to interpret their intense emotional responses to the disconnection as evidence of their putative weakness and \\xe2\\x80\\x98limited capacity to perform the work of conquest\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\n\\n\\n=== Post traumatic stress disorder ===\\n\\nSome people who experience the traumatic stress of abandonment go on to develop post traumatic symptoms. Post traumatic symptoms associated with abandonment include a sequela of heightened emotional reactions (ranging from mild to severe) and habituated defense mechanisms (many of which have become maladaptive) to perceived threats or disruptions to one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sense of self or to one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s connections.\\nThere are various predisposing psycho-biological and environmental factors that go into determining whether one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earlier emotional trauma might lead to the development of a true clinical picture of post-traumatic stress disorder. One factor has to do with variation in certain brain structures. According to Jerome Kagan, some people are born with a locus coeruleus that tends to produce higher concentrations of norepinephrine, a brain chemical involved in arousal of your body\\'s self-defense response. This would lower their threshold for becoming aroused and make them more likely to become anxious when they encounter stresses in life that are reminiscent of childhood separations and fears, hence making them more prone to becoming posttraumatic.\\n\\n\\n== References =='],\n",
       "       [b'The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear.\\n\\n\\n== Structure ==\\n\\n\\n=== Contents ===\\n\\nThe abdomen contains most of the tubelike organs of the digestive tract, as well as several solid organs. Hollow abdominal organs include the stomach, the small intestine, and the colon with its attached appendix. Organs such as the liver, its attached gallbladder, and the pancreas function in close association with the digestive tract and communicate with it via ducts. The spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands also lie within the abdomen, along with many blood vessels including the aorta and inferior vena cava. Anatomists may consider the urinary bladder, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries as either abdominal organs or as pelvic organs. Finally, the abdomen contains an extensive membrane called the peritoneum. A fold of peritoneum may completely cover certain organs, whereas it may cover only one side of organs that usually lie closer to the abdominal wall. Anatomists call the latter type of organs retroperitoneal.\\nDigestive tract: Stomach, small intestine, large intestine with cecum and appendix\\nAccessory organs of the digestive tract: Liver, gallbladder and pancreas\\nUrinary system: Kidneys and ureters \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but technically located in retroperitoneum \\xe2\\x80\\x93 outside peritoneal membrane\\nOther organs: Spleen\\nAbdominal organs can be highly specialized in some animals. For example, the stomach of ruminants (a suborder of mammals) is divided into four chambers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum. In vertebrates, the abdomen is a large cavity enclosed by the abdominal muscles, ventrally and laterally, and by the vertebral column dorsally. Lower ribs can also enclose ventral and lateral walls. The abdominal cavity is upper part of the pelvic cavity. It is attached to the thoracic cavity by the diaphragm. Structures such as the aorta, inferior vena cava and esophagus pass through the diaphragm. Both the abdominal and pelvic cavities are lined by a serous membrane known as the parietal peritoneum. This membrane is continuous with the visceral peritoneum lining the organs. The abdomen in vertebrates contains a number of organs belonging, for instance, to the digestive tract and urinary system.\\n\\n\\n=== Muscles ===\\n\\nThere are three layers of the abdominal wall. They are, from the outside to the inside: external oblique, internal oblique, and transverse abdominal. The first three layers extend between the vertebral column, the lower ribs, the iliac crest and pubis of the hip. All of their fibers merge towards the midline and surround the rectus abdominis in a sheath before joining up on the opposite side at the linea alba. Strength is gained by the criss-crossing of fibers, such that the external oblique are downward and forward, the internal oblique upward and forward, and the transverse abdominal horizontally forward.\\nThe transverse abdominal muscle is flat and triangular, with its fibers running horizontally. It lies between the internal oblique and the underlying transverse fascia. It originates from Poupart\\'s ligament, the inner lip of the ilium, the lumbar fascia and the inner surface of the cartilages of the six lower ribs. It inserts into the linea alba behind the rectus abdominis.\\nThe rectus abdominis muscles are long and flat. The muscle is crossed by three fibrous bands called the tendinous intersections. The rectus abdominis is enclosed in a thick sheath formed, as described above, by fibers from each of the three muscles of the lateral abdominal wall. They originate at the pubis bone, run up the abdomen on either side of the linea alba, and insert into the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs. In the region of the groin, the inguinal canal, a passage through the layers. This gap is where the testes can drop through the wall and where the fibrous cord from the uterus in the female runs. This is also where weakness can form, and cause inguinal hernias.\\nThe pyramidalis muscle is small and triangular. It is located in the lower abdomen in front of the rectus abdominis. It originates at the pubic bone and is inserted into the linea alba halfway up to the navel.\\n\\n\\n== Function ==\\n\\nFunctionally, the human abdomen is where most of the alimentary tract is placed and so most of the absorption and digestion of food occurs here. The alimentary tract in the abdomen consists of the lower esophagus, the stomach, the duodenum, the jejunum, ileum, the cecum and the appendix, the ascending, transverse and descending colons, the sigmoid colon and the rectum. Other vital organs inside the abdomen include the liver, the kidneys, the pancreas and the spleen.\\nThe abdominal wall is split into the posterior (back), lateral (sides), and anterior (front) walls.\\n\\n\\n=== Movement, breathing and other functions ===\\nThe abdominal muscles have different important functions. They assist in the breathing process as accessory muscles of respiration. Moreover, these muscles serve as protection for the inner organs. Furthermore, together with the back muscles they provide postural support and are important in defining the form. When the glottis is closed and the thorax and pelvis are fixed, they are integral in the cough, urination, defecation, childbirth, vomit, and singing functions. When the pelvis is fixed, they can initiate the movement of the trunk in a forward motion. They also prevent hyperextension. When the thorax is fixed, they can pull up the pelvis and finally, they can bend the vertebral column sideways and assist in the trunk\\'s rotation.\\n\\n\\n=== Posture ===\\nThe transverse abdominus muscle is the deepest muscle, therefore, it cannot be touched from the outside. It can greatly affect the body posture. The internal obliques are also deep and also affect body posture. Both of them are involved in rotation and lateral flexion of the spine and are used to bend and support the spine from the front. The external obliques are more superficial and they are also involved in rotation and lateral flexion of the spine. Also they stabilize the spine when upright. The rectus abdominus muscle is not the most superficial abdominal muscle. The tendonous sheath extending from the external obliques cover the rectus abdominus. The Rectus abdominus is the muscle that very fit people develop into the 6-pack ab look. Although, it should really be a 10 pack as there are 5 vertical sections on each side. The 2 bottom sections are just above the pubic bone and usually not visible, hence, the 6 pack abs. The rectus abdominals\\' function is to bend one\\'s back forward (flexion). The main work of the abdominal muscles is to bend the spine forward when contracting coencentrically.\\n\\n\\n== Society and culture ==\\n\\nSocial and cultural perceptions of the outward appearance of the abdomen has varying significance around the world. Depending on the type of society, excess weight can be perceived as an indicator of wealth and prestige due to excess food, or as a sign of poor health due to lack of exercise. In many cultures, bare abdomens are distinctly sexualized and perceived similarly to breast cleavage.\\n\\n\\n== Exercise ==\\n\\nBeing a key element to support the spine and contribute to a good posture, it is important to properly exercise the abdominal muscles together with the back muscles as when weak or overly tight they can suffer painful spasms as well as injuries. When properly exercised, abdominal muscles contribute to improve posture and balance, reduce the likelihood of back pain episodes, reduce the severity of back pain, protect against injury by responding efficiently to stresses, help avoid some back surgeries, and help healing from a back problem or after spine surgery. Also, when strengthened, the abdominal muscles provide flexibility as well. The abdominal muscles can be worked out by practicing disciplines of general body strength such as Pilates, yoga, T\\'ai chi, and jogging among others. There are also specific routines to target each of these muscles.\\n\\n\\n== Clinical significance ==\\nAbdominal obesity is a condition where abdominal fat or visceral fat, has built up excessively between the abdominal organs. This is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, asthma and type 2 diabetes.\\nAbdominal trauma is an injury to the abdomen and can involve damage to the abdominal organs. There is an associated risk of severe blood loss and infection. Injury to the lower chest can cause injuries to the spleen and liver.\\nA scaphoid abdomen is when the abdomen is sucked inwards. In a newborn, it may represent a diaphragmatic hernia. In general, it is indicative of malnutrition.\\n\\n\\n=== Disease ===\\nMany gastrointestinal diseases affect the abdominal organs. These include stomach disease, liver disease, pancreatic disease, gallbladder and bile duct disease; intestinal diseases include enteritis, coeliac disease, diverticulitis, and IBS.\\n\\n\\n=== Examination ===\\nDifferent medical procedures can be used to examine the organs of the gastrointestinal tract. These include endoscopy, colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, enteroscopy, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and virtual colonoscopy. There are also a number of medical imaging techniques that can be used. Surface landmarks are important in the examination of the abdomen.\\n\\n\\n==== Surface landmarks ====\\n\\nIn the mid-line a slight furrow extends from the xiphoid process above to the pubic symphysis below, representing the linea alba in the abdominal wall. At about its midpoint sits the umbilicus or navel. The rectus abdominis on each side of the linea alba stands out in muscular people. The outline of these muscles is interrupted by three or more transverse depressions indicating the tendinous intersections. There is usually one about the xiphoid process, one at the navel, and one in between. It is the combination of the linea alba and the tendinous intersections which form the abdominal \"six-pack\" sought after by many people.\\nThe upper lateral limit of the abdomen is the subcostal margin (at or near the subcostal plane) formed by the cartilages of the false ribs (8, 9, 10) joining one another. The lower lateral limit is the anterior crest of the ilium and Poupart\\'s ligament, which runs from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine of the pubis. These lower limits are marked by visible grooves. Just above the pubic spines on either side are the external abdominal rings, which are openings in the muscular wall of the abdomen through which the spermatic cord emerges in the male, and through which an inguinal hernia may rupture.\\nOne method by which the location of the abdominal contents can be appreciated is to draw three horizontal and two vertical lines.\\n\\n\\n===== Horizontal lines =====\\n\\nThe highest of the former is the transpyloric line of C. Addison, which is situated halfway between the suprasternal notch and the top of the pubic symphysis, and often cuts the pyloric opening of the stomach an inch to the right of the mid-line. The hilum of each kidney is a little below it, while its left end approximately touches the lower limit of the spleen. It corresponds to the first lumbar vertebra behind.\\nThe second line is the subcostal line, drawn from the lowest point of the subcostal arch (tenth rib). It corresponds to the upper part of the third lumbar vertebra, and it is an inch or so above the umbilicus. It indicates roughly the transverse colon, the lower ends of the kidneys, and the upper limit of the transverse (3rd) part of the duodenum.\\nThe third line is called the intertubercular line, and runs across between the two rough tubercles, which can be felt on the outer lip of the crest of the ilium about two and a half inches (60 mm) from the anterior superior spine. This line corresponds to the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra, and passes through or just above the ileo-caecal valve, where the small intestine joins the large.\\n\\n\\n===== Vertical lines =====\\nThe two vertical or mid-Poupart lines are drawn from the point midway between the anterior superior spine and the pubic symphysis on each side, vertically upward to the costal margin.\\nThe right one is the most valuable, as the ileo-caecal valve is situated where it cuts the intertubercular line. The orifice of the appendix lies an inch lower, at McBurney\\'s point. In its upper part, the vertical line meets the transpyloric line at the lower margin of the ribs, usually the ninth, and here the gallbladder is situated.\\nThe left mid-Poupart line corresponds in its upper three-quarters to the inner edge of the descending colon.\\nThe right subcostal margin corresponds to the lower limit of the liver, while the right nipple is about half an inch above its upper limit.\\n\\n\\n==== Regions ====\\n\\n\\n===== 9-region scheme =====\\n\\nThese three horizontal and two vertical lines divide the abdomen into nine \"regions.\" (Note that \"hypo\" means \"below\" and \"epi\" means \"above\", while \"chondron\" means \"cartilage\" (in this case, the cartilage of the rib) and \"gaster\" means stomach. The reversal of \"left\" and \"right\" is intentional, because the anatomical designations reflect the patient\\'s own right and left.)\\nThe right iliac fossa (RIF) is a common site of pain and tenderness in patients who have appendicitis. The fossa is named for the underlying iliac fossa of the hip bone, and thus is somewhat imprecise. Most of the anatomical structures that will produce pain and tenderness in this region are not in fact in the concavity of the ileum. However, the term is in common usage.\\n\\n\\n===== 4-region scheme =====\\n\\nAnother way of dividing the abdomen is by using 4 quadrants:\\n\\n\\n== Other animals ==\\n\\nThe invertebrate abdomen is built up of a series of upper plates known as tergites and lower plates known as sternites, the whole being held together by a tough yet stretchable membrane.\\nThe abdomen contains the insect\\'s digestive tract and reproductive organs, it consists of eleven segments in most orders of insects though the eleventh segment is absent in the adult of most higher orders. The number of these segments does vary from species to species with the number of segments visible reduced to only seven in the common honeybee. In the Collembola (Springtails) the abdomen has only six segments.\\nThe abdomen is sometimes highly modified. In Apocrita (bees, ants and wasps), the first segment of the abdomen is fused to the thorax and is called the propodeum. In ants the second segment forms the narrow petiole. Some ants have an additional postpetiole segment, and the remaining segments form the bulbous gaster. The petiole and gaster (abdominal segments 2 and onward) are collectively called the metasoma.\\nUnlike other arthropods, insects possess no legs on the abdomen in adult form, though the Protura do have rudimentary leg-like appendages on the first three abdominal segments, and Archaeognatha possess small, articulated \"styli\" which are sometimes considered to be rudimentary appendages. Many larval insects including the Lepidoptera and the Symphyta (Sawflies) have fleshy appendages called prolegs on their abdominal segments (as well as their more familiar thoracic legs), which allow them to grip onto the edges of plant leaves as they walk around.\\nIn arachnids (spiders, scorpions and relatives), the term \"abdomen\" is used interchangeably with \"opisthosoma\" (\"hind body\"), which is the body section posterior to that bearing the legs and head (the prosoma or cephalothorax).\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nAbdominal fat\\nAbdominal trauma\\nAbdominal wall\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n \"Abdomen\".

       "       [b'Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It is the first element in group 12 of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).\\nBrass, an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions, was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kalmykia, Turkmenistan and Georgia, and the second millennium BC in West India, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Israel (Judea). Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India, though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks. The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC. To date, the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc. Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called \"philosopher\\'s wool\" or \"white snow\".\\nThe element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.\\nZinc is an essential mineral, including to prenatal and postnatal development. Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia, lethargy and copper deficiency.\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Physical properties ===\\nZinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, diamagnetic metal, though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish. It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure, with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing, in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at 265.9 pm) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm. The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 \\xc2\\xb0C. Above 210 \\xc2\\xb0C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating. Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5 \\xc2\\xb0C) and boiling points (907 \\xc2\\xb0C). The melting point is the lowest of all the d-block metals aside from mercury and cadmium; for this, among other reasons, zinc, cadmium, and mercury are often not considered to be transition metals like the rest of the d-block metals are.\\nMany alloys contain zinc, including brass. Other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium, antimony, bismuth, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, tin, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, tellurium, and sodium. Although neither zinc nor zirconium are ferromagnetic, their alloy ZrZn\\n2 exhibits ferromagnetism below 35 K.\\nA bar of zinc generates a characteristic sound when bent, similar to tin cry.\\n\\n\\n=== Occurrence ===\\n\\nZinc makes up about 75 ppm (0.0075%) of Earth\\'s crust, making it the 24th most abundant element. Soil contains zinc in 5\\xe2\\x80\\x93770 ppm with an average 64 ppm. Seawater has only 30 ppb and the atmosphere, 0.1\\xe2\\x80\\x934 \\xc2\\xb5g/m3.\\n\\nThe element is normally found in association with other base metals such as copper and lead in ores. Zinc is a chalcophile, meaning the element has a low affinity for oxides and prefers to bond with sulfides. Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth\\'s atmosphere. Sphalerite, which is a form of zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60\\xe2\\x80\\x9362% zinc.\\nOther source minerals for zinc include smithsonite (zinc carbonate), hemimorphite (zinc silicate), wurtzite (another zinc sulfide), and sometimes hydrozincite (basic zinc carbonate). With the exception of wurtzite, all these other minerals were formed by weathering of the primordial zinc sulfides.\\nIdentified world zinc resources total about 1.9\\xe2\\x80\\x932.8 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States, with the largest reserves in Iran. The most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc (meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and production practices) was made in 2009 and calculated to be roughly 480 Mt. Zinc reserves, on the other hand, are geologically identified ore bodies whose suitability for recovery is economically based (location, grade, quality, and quantity) at the time of determination. Since exploration and mine development is an ongoing process, the amount of zinc reserves is not a fixed number and sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today\\'s zinc mines. This concept is well supported by data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and scholars have estimated that about 109\\xe2\\x80\\x93305 million tonnes are in use.\\n\\n\\n=== Isotopes ===\\n\\nFive isotopes of zinc occur in nature. 64Zn is the most abundant isotope (48.63% natural abundance). That isotope has such a long half-life, at 4.3\\xc3\\x971018 years, that its radioactivity can be ignored. Similarly, 70Zn (0.6%), with a half-life of 1.3\\xc3\\x971016 years is not usually considered to be radioactive. The other isotopes found in nature are 66Zn (28%), 67Zn (4%) and 68Zn (19%).\\nSeveral dozen radioisotopes have been characterized. 65Zn, which has a half-life of 243.66 days, is the least active radioisotope, followed by 72Zn with a half-life of 46.5 hours. Zinc has 10 nuclear isomers. 69mZn has the longest half-life, 13.76 h. The superscript m indicates a metastable isotope. The nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma ray. 61Zn has three excited states and 73Zn has two. The isotopes 65Zn, 71Zn, 77Zn and 78Zn each have only one excited state.\\nThe most common decay mode of a radioisotope of zinc with a mass number lower than 66 is electron capture. The decay product resulting from electron capture is an isotope of copper.\\nn\\n30Zn + e\\xe2\\x88\\x92 \\xe2\\x86\\x92 n\\n29Cu\\nThe most common decay mode of a radioisotope of zinc with mass number higher than 66 is beta decay (\\xce\\xb2\\xe2\\x88\\x92), which produces an isotope of gallium.\\nn\\n30Zn \\xe2\\x86\\x92 n\\n31Ga + e\\xe2\\x88\\x92 + \\xce\\xbd\\ne\\n\\n\\n== Compounds and chemistry ==\\n\\n\\n=== Reactivity ===\\n\\nZinc has an electron configuration of [Ar]3d104s2 and is a member of the group 12 of the periodic table. It is a moderately reactive metal and strong reducing agent. The surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly, eventually forming a protective passivating layer of the basic zinc carbonate, Zn\\n5(OH)\\n6(CO3)\\n2, by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide. This layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water.\\nZinc burns in air with a bright bluish-green flame, giving off fumes of zinc oxide. Zinc reacts readily with acids, alkalis and other non-metals. Extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at room temperature with acids. Strong acids, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, can remove the passivating layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas.\\nThe chemistry of zinc is dominated by the +2 oxidation state. When compounds in this oxidation state are formed, the outer shell s electrons are lost, yielding a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration [Ar]3d10. In aqueous solution an octahedral complex, [Zn(H\\n2O)6]2+ is the predominant species. The volatilization of zinc in combination with zinc chloride at temperatures above 285 \\xc2\\xb0C indicates the formation of Zn\\n2Cl\\n2, a zinc compound with a +1 oxidation state. No compounds of zinc in oxidation states other than +1 or +2 are known. Calculations indicate that a zinc compound with the oxidation state of +4 is unlikely to exist.\\nZinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals, nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure, and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor, the chemistry of zinc has much in common with that of magnesium. In other respects, there is little similarity with the late first-row transition metals. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known.\\n\\n\\n=== Zinc(I) compounds ===\\nZinc(I) compounds are rare and need bulky ligands to stabilize the low oxidation state. Most zinc(I) compounds contain formally the [Zn2]2+ core, which is analogous to the [Hg2]2+ dimeric cation present in mercury(I) compounds. The diamagnetic nature of the ion confirms its dimeric structure. The first zinc(I) compound containing the Zn\\xe2\\x80\\x93Zn bond, (\\xce\\xb75-C5Me5)2Zn2, is also the first dimetallocene. The [Zn2]2+ ion rapidly disproportionates into zinc metal and zinc(II), and has been obtained only a yellow glass only by cooling a solution of metallic zinc in molten ZnCl2.\\n\\n\\n=== Zinc(II) compounds ===\\n\\nBinary compounds of zinc are known for most of the metalloids and all the nonmetals except the noble gases. The oxide ZnO is a white powder that is nearly insoluble in neutral aqueous solutions, but is amphoteric, dissolving in both strong basic and acidic solutions. The other chalcogenides (ZnS, ZnSe, and ZnTe) have varied applications in electronics and optics. Pnictogenides (Zn\\n3N\\n2, Zn\\n3P\\n2, Zn\\n3As\\n2 and Zn\\n3Sb\\n2), the peroxide (ZnO\\n2), the hydride (ZnH\\n2), and the carbide (ZnC\\n2) are also known. Of the four halides, ZnF\\n2 has the most ionic character, while the others (ZnCl\\n2, ZnBr\\n2, and ZnI\\n2) have relatively low melting points and are considered to have more covalent character.\\nIn weak basic solutions containing Zn2+ ions, the hydroxide Zn(OH)\\n2 forms as a white precipitate. In stronger alkaline solutions, this hydroxide is dissolved to form zincates ([Zn(OH)4]2\\xe2\\x88\\x92). The nitrate Zn(NO3)\\n2, chlorate Zn(ClO3)\\n2, sulfate ZnSO\\n4, phosphate Zn\\n3(PO4)\\n2, molybdate ZnMoO\\n4, cyanide Zn(CN)\\n2, arsenite Zn(AsO2)\\n2, arsenate Zn(AsO4)\\n2\\xc2\\xb78H\\n2O and the chromate ZnCrO\\n4 (one of the few colored zinc compounds) are a few examples of other common inorganic compounds of zinc. One of the simplest examples of an organic compound of zinc is the acetate (Zn(O\\n2CCH3)\\n2).\\nOrganozinc compounds are those that contain zinc\\xe2\\x80\\x93carbon covalent bonds. Diethylzinc ((C\\n2H5)\\n2Zn) is a reagent in synthetic chemistry. It was first reported in 1848 from the reaction of zinc and ethyl iodide, and was the first compound known to contain a metal\\xe2\\x80\\x93carbon sigma bond.\\n\\n\\n=== Test for zinc ===\\nCobalticyanide paper (Rinnmann\\'s test for Zn) can be used as a chemical indicator for zinc. 4 g of K3Co(CN)6 and 1 g of KClO3 is dissolved on 100 ml of water. Paper is dipped in the solution and dried at 100 \\xc2\\xb0C. One drop of the sample is dropped onto the dry paper and heated. A green disc indicates the presence of zinc.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Ancient use ===\\n\\nVarious isolated examples of the use of impure zinc in ancient times have been discovered. Zinc ores were used to make the zinc\\xe2\\x80\\x93copper alloy brass thousands of years prior to the discovery of zinc as a separate element. Judean brass from the 14th to 10th centuries BC contains 23% zinc.\\nKnowledge of how to produce brass spread to Ancient Greece by the 7th century BC, but few varieties were made. Ornaments made of alloys containing 80\\xe2\\x80\\x9390% zinc, with lead, iron, antimony, and other metals making up the remainder, have been found that are 2,500 years old. A possibly prehistoric statuette containing 87.5% zinc was found in a Dacian archaeological site.\\nThe oldest known pills were made of the zinc carbonates hydrozincite and smithsonite. The pills were used for sore eyes and were found aboard the Roman ship Relitto del Pozzino, wrecked in 140 BC.\\nThe manufacture of brass was known to the Romans by about 30 BC. They made brass by heating powdered calamine (zinc silicate or carbonate), charcoal and copper together in a crucible. The resulting calamine brass was then either cast or hammered into shape for use in weaponry. Some coins struck by Romans in the Christian era are made of what is probably calamine brass.\\nStrabo writing in the 1st century BC (but quoting a now lost work of the 4th century BC historian Theopompus) mentions \"drops of false silver\" which when mixed with copper make brass. This may refer to small quantities of zinc that is a by-product of smelting sulfide ores. Zinc in such remnants in smelting ovens was usually discarded as it was thought to be worthless.\\nThe Berne zinc tablet is a votive plaque dating to Roman Gaul made of an alloy that is mostly zinc.\\nThe Charaka Samhita, thought to have been written between 300 and 500 AD, mentions a metal which, when oxidized, produces pushpanjan, thought to be zinc oxide. Zinc mines at Zawar, near Udaipur in India, have been active since the Mauryan period (c.\\xe2\\x80\\x89 322 and 187 BCE). The smelting of metallic zinc here, however, appears to have begun around the 12th century AD. One estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries. Another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period. The Rasaratna Samuccaya, written in approximately the 13th century AD, mentions two types of zinc-containing ores: one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes.\\n\\n\\n=== Early studies and naming ===\\nZinc was distinctly recognized as a metal under the designation of Yasada or Jasada in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king Madanapala (of Taka dynasty) and written about the year 1374. Smelting and extraction of impure zinc by reducing calamine with wool and other organic substances was accomplished in the 13th century in India. The Chinese did not learn of the technique until the 17th century.\\n\\nAlchemists burned zinc metal in air and collected the resulting zinc oxide on a condenser. Some alchemists called this zinc oxide lana philosophica, Latin for \"philosopher\\'s wool\", because it collected in wooly tufts, whereas others thought it looked like white snow and named it nix album.\\nThe name of the metal was probably first documented by Paracelsus, a Swiss-born German alchemist, who referred to the metal as \"zincum\" or \"zinken\" in his book Liber Mineralium II, in the 16th century. The word is probably derived from the German zinke, and supposedly meant \"tooth-like, pointed or jagged\" (metallic zinc crystals have a needle-like appearance). Zink could also imply \"tin-like\" because of its relation to German zinn meaning tin. Yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the Persian word \\xd8\\xb3\\xd9\\x86\\xda\\xaf seng meaning stone. The metal was also called Indian tin, tutanego, calamine, and spinter.\\nGerman metallurgist Andreas Libavius received a quantity of what he called \"calay\" of Malabar from a cargo ship captured from the Portuguese in 1596. Libavius described the properties of the sample, which may have been zinc. Zinc was regularly imported to Europe from the Orient in the 17th and early 18th centuries, but was at times very expensive.\\n\\n\\n=== Isolation ===\\n\\nMetallic zinc was isolated in India by 1300 AD, much earlier than in the West. Before it was isolated in Europe, it was imported from India in about 1600 CE. Postlewayt\\'s Universal Dictionary, a contemporary source giving technological information in Europe, did not mention zinc before 1751 but the element was studied before then.\\nFlemish metallurgist and alchemist P. M. de Respour reported that he had extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668. By the start of the 18th century, \\xc3\\x89tienne Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois Geoffroy described how zinc oxide condenses as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore that is being smelted. In Britain, John Lane is said to have carried out experiments to smelt zinc, probably at Landore, prior to his bankruptcy in 1726.\\nIn 1738 in Great Britain, William Champion patented a process to extract zinc from calamine in a vertical retort style smelter. His technique resembled that used at Zawar zinc mines in Rajasthan, but no evidence suggests he visited the Orient. Champion\\'s process was used through 1851.\\nGerman chemist Andreas Marggraf normally gets credit for discovering pure metallic zinc, even though Swedish chemist Anton von Swab had distilled zinc from calamine four years previously. In his 1746 experiment, Marggraf heated a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal. This procedure became commercially practical by 1752.\\n\\n\\n=== Later work ===\\n\\nWilliam Champion\\'s brother, John, patented a process in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process. Prior to this, only calamine could be used to produce zinc. In 1798, Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter. Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium that processed even more zinc. Italian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog\\'s leg to twitch. He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect \"animal electricity\". The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani, and his discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries, galvanization, and cathodic protection.\\nGalvani\\'s friend, Alessandro Volta, continued researching the effect and invented the Voltaic pile in 1800. The basic unit of Volta\\'s pile was a simplified galvanic cell, made of plates of copper and zinc separated by an electrolyte and connected by a conductor externally. The units were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell, which produced electricity by directing electrons from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode.\\nThe non-magnetic character of zinc and its lack of color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition. This changed in 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site. The digestive enzyme carboxypeptidase became the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.\\n\\n\\n== Production ==\\n\\n\\n=== Mining and processing ===\\n\\nZinc is the fourth most common metal in use, trailing only iron, aluminium, and copper with an annual production of about 13 million tonnes. The world\\'s largest zinc producer is Nyrstar, a merger of the Australian OZ Minerals and the Belgian Umicore. About 70% of the world\\'s zinc originates from mining, while the remaining 30% comes from recycling secondary zinc. Commercially pure zinc is known as Special High Grade, often abbreviated SHG, and is 99.995% pure.\\nWorldwide, 95% of new zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits, in which sphalerite (ZnS) is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper, lead and iron. Zinc mines are scattered throughout the world, with the main areas being China, Australia, and Peru. China produced 38% of the global zinc output in 2014.\\nZinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy. The ore is finely ground, then put through froth flotation to separate minerals from gangue (on the property of hydrophobicity), to get a zinc sulfide ore concentrate consisting of about 50% zinc, 32% sulfur, 13% iron, and 5% SiO\\n2.\\nRoasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate to zinc oxide:\\n2 ZnS + 3 O\\n2 \\xe2\\x86\\x92 2 ZnO + 2 SO\\n2\\nThe sulfur dioxide is used for the production of sulfuric acid, which is necessary for the leaching process. If deposits of zinc carbonate, zinc silicate, or zinc spinel (like the Skorpion Deposit in Namibia) are used for zinc production, the roasting can be omitted.\\nFor further processing two basic methods are used: pyrometallurgy or electrowinning. Pyrometallurgy reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at 950 \\xc2\\xb0C (1,740 \\xc2\\xb0F) into the metal, which is distilled as zinc vapor to separate it from other metals, which are not volatile at those temperatures. The zinc vapor is collected in a condenser. The equations below describe this process:\\n2 ZnO + C \\xe2\\x86\\x92 2 Zn + CO\\n2\\nZnO + CO \\xe2\\x86\\x92 Zn + CO\\n2\\nIn electrowinning, zinc is leached from the ore concentrate by sulfuric acid:\\nZnO + H\\n2SO\\n4 \\xe2\\x86\\x92 ZnSO\\n4 + H\\n2O\\nFinally, the zinc is reduced by electrolysis.\\n2 ZnSO\\n4 + 2 H\\n2O \\xe2\\x86\\x92 2 Zn + 2 H\\n2SO\\n4 + O\\n2\\nThe sulfuric acid is regenerated and recycled to the leaching step.\\nWhen galvanised feedstock is fed to an electric arc furnace, the zinc is recovered from the dust by a number of processes, predominately the Waelz process (90% as of 2014).\\n\\n\\n=== Environmental impact ===\\nRefinement of sulfidic zinc ores produces large volumes of sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities of metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombi\\xc3\\xa8res between 1806 and 1882. The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul River contain non-trivial amounts of metals. About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20 to 1.\\nZinc in rivers flowing through industrial and mining areas can be as high as 20 ppm. Effective sewage treatment greatly reduces this; treatment along the Rhine, for example, has decreased zinc levels to 50 ppb. Concentrations of zinc as low as 2 ppm adversely affects the amount of oxygen that fish can carry in their blood.\\n\\nSoils contaminated with zinc from mining, refining, or fertilizing with zinc-bearing sludge can contain several grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil. Levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. Zinc levels of 2000 ppm to 180,000 ppm (18%) have been recorded in some soil samples.\\n\\n\\n== Applications ==\\nMajor applications of zinc include (numbers are given for the US)\\nGalvanizing (55%)\\nBrass and bronze (16%)\\nOther alloys (21%)\\nMiscellaneous (8%)\\n\\n\\n=== Anti-corrosion and batteries ===\\n\\nZinc is most commonly used as an anti-corrosion agent, and galvanization (coating of iron or steel) is the most familiar form. In 2009 in the United States, 55% or 893 thousand tonnes of the zinc metal was used for galvanization.\\nZinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away. A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate (Zn\\n5(OH)\\n6(CO\\n3)\\n2) forms as the zinc corrodes. This protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away. The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies.\\nThe relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship\\'s iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.\\nWith a standard electrode potential (SEP) of \\xe2\\x88\\x920.76 volts, zinc is used as an anode material for batteries. (More reactive lithium (SEP \\xe2\\x88\\x923.04 V) is used for anodes in lithium batteries ). Powdered zinc is used in this way in alkaline batteries and the case (which also serves as the anode) of zinc\\xe2\\x80\\x93carbon batteries is formed from sheet zinc. Zinc is used as the anode or fuel of the zinc-air battery/fuel cell. The zinc-cerium redox flow battery also relies on a zinc-based negative half-cell.\\n\\n\\n=== Alloys ===\\nA widely used zinc alloy is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, depending upon the type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper, and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves.\\n\\nOther widely used zinc alloys include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in pipes. Alloys of 85\\xe2\\x80\\x9388% zinc, 4\\xe2\\x80\\x9310% copper, and 2\\xe2\\x80\\x938% aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings. Zinc is the primary metal in American one cent coins (pennies) since 1982. The zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the appearance of a copper coin. In 1994, 33,200 tonnes (36,600 short tons) of zinc were used to produce 13.6 billion pennies in the United States.\\nAlloys of zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An example of this is zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.\\nSimilar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive. For building facades, roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing, roll forming, or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.\\nAs a dense, inexpensive, easily worked material, zinc is used as a lead replacement. In the wake of lead concerns, zinc appears in weights for various applications ranging from fishing to tire balances and flywheels.\\nCadmium zinc telluride (CZT) is a semiconductive alloy that can be divided into an array of small sensing devices. These devices are similar to an integrated circuit and can detect the energy of incoming gamma ray photons. When behind an absorbing mask, the CZT sensor array can determine the direction of the rays.\\n\\n\\n=== Other industrial uses ===\\n\\nRoughly one quarter of all zinc output in the United States in 2009 was consumed in zinc compounds; a variety of which are used industrially. Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a catalyst in the manufacture of rubber to disburse heat. Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation (UV). The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products. The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production.\\nZinc chloride is often added to lumber as a fire retardant and sometimes as a wood preservative. It is used in the manufacture of other chemicals. Zinc methyl (Zn(CH3)\\n2) is used in a number of organic syntheses. Zinc sulfide (ZnS) is used in luminescent pigments such as on the hands of clocks, X-ray and television screens, and luminous paints. Crystals of ZnS are used in lasers that operate in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum. Zinc sulfate is a chemical in dyes and pigments. Zinc pyrithione is used in antifouling paints.\\nZinc powder is sometimes used as a propellant in model rockets. When a compressed mixture of 70% zinc and 30% sulfur powder is ignited there is a violent chemical reaction. This produces zinc sulfide, together with large amounts of hot gas, heat, and light.\\nZinc sheet metal is used to make zinc bars.\\n64Zn, the most abundant isotope of zinc, is very susceptible to neutron activation, being transmuted into the highly radioactive 65Zn, which has a half-life of 244 days and produces intense gamma radiation. Because of this, zinc oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti-corrosion agent is depleted of 64Zn before use, this is called depleted zinc oxide. For the same reason, zinc has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons (cobalt is another, better-known salting material). A jacket of isotopically enriched 64Zn would be irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon, forming a large amount of 65Zn significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon\\'s fallout. Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built, tested, or used.\\n65Zn is used as a tracer to study how alloys that contain zinc wear out, or the path and the role of zinc in organisms.\\nZinc dithiocarbamate complexes are used as agricultural fungicides; these include Zineb, Metiram, Propineb and Ziram. Zinc naphthenate is used as wood preservative. Zinc in the form of ZDDP, is used as an anti-wear additive for metal parts in engine oil.\\n\\n\\n=== Organic chemistry ===\\n\\nOrganozinc chemistry is the science of compounds that contain carbon-zinc bonds, describing the physical properties, synthesis, and chemical reactions.Many organozinc compounds are important. Among important applications are\\nThe Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester (ROCOCOOR) reacts with an alkyl halide R\\'X, zinc and hydrochloric acid to form the \\xce\\xb1-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR\\'COHCOOR\\nThe Reformatskii reaction in which \\xce\\xb1-halo-esters and aldehydes are converted to \\xce\\xb2-hydroxy-esters\\nThe Simmons\\xe2\\x80\\x93Smith reaction in which the carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide reacts with alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane\\nThe Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to form carbonyl compounds\\nThe Barbier reaction (1899), which is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is the better of the two. In presence of water, formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the Barbier reaction can take place in water.\\nOn the downside, organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, and they are expensive and difficult to handle. Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc, diethylzinc and diphenylzinc. In one study, the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors\\nThe Negishi coupling is also an important reaction for the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds between unsaturated carbon atoms in alkenes, arenes and alkynes. The catalysts are nickel and palladium. A key step in the catalytic cycle is a transmetalation in which a zinc halide exchanges its organic substituent for another halogen with the palladium (nickel) metal center.\\nThe Fukuyama coupling is another coupling reaction, but it uses a thioester as reactant and produces a ketone.\\nZinc has found many applications as catalyst in organic synthesis including asymmetric synthesis, being cheap and easily available alternative to precious metal complexes. The results (yield and ee) obtained with chiral zinc catalysts are comparable to those achieved with palladium, ruthenium, iridium and others, and zinc becomes metal catalyst of choice.\\n\\n\\n=== Dietary supplement ===\\n\\nIn most single-tablet, over-the-counter, daily vitamin and mineral supplements, zinc is included in such forms as zinc oxide, zinc acetate, or zinc gluconate. Zinc is generally considered to be an antioxidant. However, it is redox inert and thus can serve such a function only indirectly.\\nZinc deficiency has been associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), and zinc supplements may be an effective treatment.\\nZinc serves as a simple, inexpensive, and critical tool for treating diarrheal episodes among children in the developing world. Zinc becomes depleted in the body during diarrhea, but recent studies suggest that replenishing zinc with a 10- to 14-day course of treatment can reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes and may also prevent future episodes for as long as three months.\\nA Cochrane review stated that people taking zinc supplement may be less likely to progress to age-related macular degeneration.\\nZinc supplement is an effective treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica, a genetic disorder affecting zinc absorption that was previously fatal to affected infants.\\nGastroenteritis is strongly attenuated by ingestion of zinc, possibly by direct antimicrobial action of the ions in the gastrointestinal tract, or by the absorption of the zinc and re-release from immune cells (all granulocytes secrete zinc), or both.\\nIn 2011, researchers reported that adding large amounts of zinc to a urine sample masked detection of drugs. The researchers did not test whether orally consuming a zinc dietary supplement could have the same effect.\\n\\n\\n==== Common cold ====\\n\\nZinc supplements (frequently zinc acetate or zinc gluconate lozenges) are a group of dietary supplements that are commonly used for the treatment of the common cold. The use of zinc supplements at doses in excess of 75 mg/day within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms has been shown to reduce the duration of cold symptoms by about 1 day. Due to a lack of data, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the preventative use of zinc supplements reduces the likelihood of contracting a cold. Adverse effects with zinc supplements by mouth include bad taste and nausea. The intranasal use of zinc-containing nasal sprays has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell; consequently, in June 2009, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) warned consumers to stop using intranasal zinc products.\\nThe human rhinovirus \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the most common viral pathogen in humans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is the predominant cause of the common cold. The hypothesized mechanism of action by which zinc reduces the severity and/or duration of cold symptoms is the suppression of nasal inflammation and the direct inhibition of rhinoviral receptor binding and rhinoviral replication in the nasal mucosa.\\n\\n\\n=== Topical use ===\\n\\nTopical preparations of zinc include those used on the skin, often in the form of zinc oxide. Zinc preparations can protect against sunburn in the summer and windburn in the winter. Applied thinly to a baby\\'s diaper area (perineum) with each diaper change, it can protect against diaper rash.\\nChelated zinc is used in toothpastes and mouthwashes to prevent bad breath.\\nZinc pyrithione is widely included in shampoos to prevent dandruff.\\n\\n\\n== Biological role ==\\nZinc is an essential trace element for humans and other animals, for plants and for microorganisms. Zinc is found in nearly 100 specific enzymes (other sources say 300), serves as structural ions in transcription factors and is stored and transferred in metallothioneins. It is \"typically the second most abundant transition metal in organisms\" after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes.\\nIn proteins, zinc ions are often coordinated to the amino acid side chains of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine and histidine. The theoretical and computational description of this zinc binding in proteins (as well as that of other transition metals) is difficult.\\nBetween 2 and 4 grams of zinc are distributed throughout the human body. Most zinc is in the brain, muscle, bones, kidney, and liver, with the highest concentrations in the prostate and parts of the eye. Semen is particularly rich in zinc, a key factor in prostate gland function and reproductive organ growth.\\nIn humans, the biological roles of zinc are ubiquitous. It interacts with \"a wide range of organic ligands\", and has roles in the metabolism of RNA and DNA, signal transduction, and gene expression. It also regulates apoptosis. A 2006 study estimated that about 10% of human proteins (2800) potentially bind zinc, in addition to hundreds more that transport and traffic zinc; a similar in silico study in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana found 2367 zinc-related proteins.\\nIn the brain, zinc is stored in specific synaptic vesicles by glutamatergic neurons and can modulate neuronal excitability. It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and so in learning. However, it has been called \"the brain\\'s dark horse\" because it also can be a neurotoxin, suggesting zinc homeostasis plays a critical role in the functional regulation of the central nervous system. Dysregulation of zinc homeostasis in the central nervous system that results in excessive synaptic zinc concentrations is believed to induce neurotoxicity through mitochondrial oxidative stress (e.g., by disrupting certain enzymes involved in the electron transport chain, including complex I, complex III, and \\xce\\xb1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase), the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, glutamatergic neuronal excitotoxicity, and interference with intraneuronal signal transduction. L- and D-histidine facilitate brain zinc uptake. SLC30A3 is the primary zinc transporter involved in cerebral zinc homeostasis.\\n\\n\\n=== Enzymes ===\\n\\nZinc is an efficient Lewis acid, making it a useful catalytic agent in hydroxylation and other enzymatic reactions. The metal also has a flexible coordination geometry, which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift conformations to perform biological reactions. Two examples of zinc-containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase, which are vital to the processes of carbon dioxide (CO\\n2) regulation and digestion of proteins, respectively.\\nIn vertebrate blood, carbonic anhydrase converts CO\\n2 into bicarbonate and the same enzyme transforms the bicarbonate back into CO\\n2 for exhalation through the lungs. Without this enzyme, this conversion would occur about one million times slower at the normal blood pH of 7 or would require a pH of 10 or more. The non-related \\xce\\xb2-carbonic anhydrase is required in plants for leaf formation, the synthesis of indole acetic acid (auxin) and alcoholic fermentation.\\nCarboxypeptidase cleaves peptide linkages during digestion of proteins. A coordinate covalent bond is formed between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, which gives the carbon a positive charge. This helps to create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the non-polar part of the protein being digested.\\n\\n\\n=== Other proteins ===\\nZinc serves a purely structural role in zinc fingers, twists and clusters. Zinc fingers form parts of some transcription factors, which are proteins that recognize DNA base sequences during the replication and transcription of DNA. Each of the nine or ten Zn2+ ions in a zinc finger helps maintain the finger\\'s structure by coordinately binding to four amino acids in the transcription factor. The transcription factor wraps around the DNA helix and uses its fingers to accurately bind to the DNA sequence.\\nIn blood plasma, zinc is bound to and transported by albumin (60%, low-affinity) and transferrin (10%). Because transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice versa. A similar antagonism exists with copper. The concentration of zinc in blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless of zinc intake. Cells in the salivary gland, prostate, immune system, and intestine use zinc signaling to communicate with other cells.\\nZinc may be held in metallothionein reserves within microorganisms or in the intestines or liver of animals. Metallothionein in intestinal cells is capable of adjusting absorption of zinc by 15\\xe2\\x80\\x9340%. However, inadequate or excessive zinc intake can be harmful; excess zinc particularly impairs copper absorption because metallothionein absorbs both metals.\\nThe human dopamine transporter contains a high affinity extracellular zinc binding site which, upon zinc binding, inhibits dopamine reuptake and amplifies amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux in vitro. The human serotonin transporter and norepinephrine transporter do not contain zinc binding sites.\\n\\n\\n=== Dietary recommendations ===\\nThe U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for zinc in 2001. The current EARs for zinc for women and men ages 14 and up is 6.8 and 9.4 mg/day, respectively. The RDAs are 8 and 11 mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 11 mg/day. RDA for lactation is 12 mg/day. For infants up to 12 months the RDA is 3 mg/day. For children ages 1\\xe2\\x80\\x9313 years the RDA increases with age from 3 to 8 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of zinc the adult UL is 40 mg/day (lower for children). Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).\\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in United States. For people ages 18 and older the PRI calculations are complex, as the EFSA has set higher and higher values as the phytate content of the diet increases. For women, PRIs increase from 7.5 to 12.7 mg/day as phytate intake increases from 300 to 1200 mg/day; for men the range is 9.4 to 16.3 mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 25 mg/day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.\\nFor U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For zinc labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 15 mg, but as of May 27, 2016 it has been revised to 11 mg. A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. Food and supplement companies have until January 1, 2020 to comply with the change.\\n\\n\\n=== Dietary intake ===\\n\\nAnimal products (meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, dairy) contain zinc. The concentration of zinc in plants varies with the level in the soil. With adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds (sesame, poppy, alfalfa, celery, mustard). Zinc is also found in beans, nuts, almonds, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and blackcurrant. Plant phytates interfere with zinc absorption, so people consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet may need to increase zinc intake.\\nOther sources include fortified food and dietary supplements in various forms. A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide, one of the most common supplements in the United States, and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body. This review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate than in those who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts. For fortification, however, a 2003 review recommended cereals (containing zinc oxide) as a cheap, stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms. A 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc, including oxide and sulfate, did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas.\\n\\n\\n=== Deficiency ===\\n\\nZinc deficiency is usually due to insufficient dietary intake, but can be associated with malabsorption, acrodermatitis enteropathica, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes, malignancy, and other chronic illnesses. Groups at risk for zinc deficiency include the elderly, children in developing countries, and those with renal dysfunction.\\nIn the United States, a federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19, average consumption was 9.7 and 14.2 mg/day, respectively. For women, 17% consumed less than the EAR, for men 11%. The percentages below EAR increased with age. The most recent published update of the survey (NHANES 2013\\xe2\\x80\\x932014) reported lower averages \\xe2\\x80\\x93 9.3 and 13.2 mg/day \\xe2\\x80\\x93 again with intake decreasing with age.\\nSymptoms of mild zinc deficiency are diverse. Clinical outcomes include depressed growth, diarrhea, impotence and delayed sexual maturation, alopecia, eye and skin lesions, impaired appetite, altered cognition, impaired host defense properties, defects in carbohydrate utilization, and reproductive teratogenesis. Mild zinc deficiency depresses immunity, although excessive zinc does also. Animals with a zinc deficiency require twice as much food to attain the same weight gain as animals with sufficient zinc.\\nDespite some concerns, western vegetarians and vegans do not suffer any more from overt zinc deficiency than meat-eaters. Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans, sea vegetables, fortified cereals, soy foods, nuts, peas, and seeds. However, phytates in many whole-grains and fibers may interfere with zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects. The zinc chelator phytate, found in seeds and cereal bran, can contribute to zinc malabsorption. Some evidence suggests that more than the US RDA (15 mg) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates, such as some vegetarians. These considerations must be balanced against the paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers, and the most widely used indicator, plasma zinc, has poor sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge.\\nNearly two billion people in the developing world are deficient in zinc. In children, it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many in the developing world have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients.\\n\\n\\n=== Soil remediation ===\\nSpecies of Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium can grow in zinc metalliferous soils, because translocation of toxic ions is prevented by the action of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi.\\n\\n\\n=== Agriculture ===\\nZinc deficiency appears to be the most common micronutrient deficiency in crop plants; it is particularly common in high-pH soils. Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia. Substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas. Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is added to the soil primarily through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide (zinc phosphide), limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.\\n\\n\\n== Precautions ==\\n\\n\\n=== Toxicity ===\\nAlthough zinc is an essential requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.\\nThe free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride. Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.\\nEvidence shows that people taking 100\\xe2\\x80\\x93300 mg of zinc daily may suffer induced copper deficiency. A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo. Levels of 100\\xe2\\x80\\x93300 mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol. Zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interferes with the plant absorption of other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. A condition called the zinc shakes or \"zinc chills\" can be induced by inhalation of zinc fumes while brazing or welding galvanized materials. Zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between 17 and 38 mg of zinc per gram. Disability and even deaths from excessive use of these products have been claimed.\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose, causing anosmia. Reports of anosmia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections. On June 16, 2009, the FDA ordered removal of zinc-based intranasal cold products from store shelves. The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke, and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it.\\nRecent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent heat shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes.\\n\\n\\n=== Poisoning ===\\nIn 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies coated in copper but containing primarily zinc. Zinc pennies pose a risk of zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1 kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12 grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.\\nPennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs, requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms. Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal. The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of countries by zinc production\\nSpelter\\nWet storage stain\\nZinc alloy electroplating\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nZinc Fact Sheet from the U.S. National Institutes of Health\\nHistory & Etymology of Zinc\\nStatistics and Information from the U.S. Geological Survey\\nReducing Agents > Zinc\\nAmerican Zinc Association Information about the uses and properties of zinc.\\nOutline safety data for zinc\\nISZB International Society for Zinc Biology, founded in 2008.

       "       [b'Zoophilia is a paraphilia involving a sexual fixation on non-human animals. Bestiality is cross-species sexual activity between human and non-human animals. The terms are often used interchangeably, but some researchers make a distinction between the attraction (zoophilia) and the act (bestiality).\\nAlthough sex with animals is not outlawed in some countries, in most countries, bestiality is illegal under animal abuse laws or laws dealing with buggery or crimes against nature.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\n\\n\\n=== General ===\\nThree key terms commonly used in regards to the subject \\xe2\\x80\\x94 zoophilia, bestiality, and zoosexuality \\xe2\\x80\\x94 are often used somewhat interchangeably. Some researchers distinguish between zoophilia (as a persistent sexual interest in animals) and bestiality (as sexual acts with animals), because bestiality is often not driven by a sexual preference for animals. Some studies have found that a preference for animals is rare among people who engage in sexual contact with animals. Furthermore, some zoophiles report that they have never had sexual contact with an animal. People with zoophilia are known as \"zoophiles\", though also sometimes as \"zoosexuals\", or even very simply \"zoos\". Zooerasty, sodomy, and zooerastia are other terms closely related to the subject but are less synonymous with the former terms, and are seldom used. \"Bestiosexuality\" was discussed briefly by Allen (1979), but never became widely established. Ernest Bornemann (1990, cited by Rosenbauer, 1997) coined the separate term zoosadism for those who derive pleasure \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sexual or otherwise \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from inflicting pain on animals. Zoosadism specifically is one member of the Macdonald triad of precursors to sociopathic behavior.\\n\\n\\n=== Zoophilia ===\\nThe term zoophilia was introduced into the field of research on sexuality in Psychopathia Sexualis (1886) by Krafft-Ebing, who described a number of cases of \"violation of animals (bestiality)\", as well as \"zoophilia erotica\", which he defined as a sexual attraction to animal skin or fur. The term zoophilia derives from the combination of two nouns in Greek: \\xce\\xb6\\xe1\\xbf\\xb7\\xce\\xbf\\xce\\xbd (z\\xe1\\xb9\\x93ion, meaning \"animal\") and \\xcf\\x86\\xce\\xb9\\xce\\xbb\\xce\\xaf\\xce\\xb1 (philia, meaning \"(fraternal) love\"). In general contemporary usage, the term zoophilia may refer to sexual activity between human and non-human animals, the desire to engage in such, or to the specific paraphilia (i.e., the atypical arousal) which indicates a definite preference for non-human animals over humans as sexual partners. Although Krafft-Ebing also coined the term zooerasty for the paraphilia of exclusive sexual attraction to animals, that term has fallen out of general use.\\n\\n\\n=== Zoosexuality ===\\n\\nThe term zoosexual was proposed by Hani Miletski in 2002 as a value-neutral term. Usage of zoosexual as a noun (in reference to a person) is synonymous with zoophile, while the adjectival form of the word \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as, for instance, in the phrase \"zoosexual act\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 may indicate sexual activity between a human and a non-human animal. The derivative noun \"zoosexuality\" is sometimes used by self-identified zoophiles in both support groups and on internet-based discussion forums to designate sexual orientation manifesting as romantic or emotional involvement with, or sexual attraction to, non-human animals.\\n\\n\\n=== Bestiality ===\\n\\nThe legal term bestiality has three common pronunciations: [\\xcb\\x8cbest\\xca\\x83i\\xcb\\x88\\xc3\\xa6l\\xc9\\x99ti] or [\\xcb\\x8cbist\\xca\\x83i\\xcb\\x88\\xc3\\xa6l\\xc9\\x99ti] in the United States, and [\\xcb\\x8cbesti\\xcb\\x88\\xc3\\xa6l\\xc9\\x99ti] in the United Kingdom. Some zoophiles and researchers draw a distinction between zoophilia and bestiality, using the former to describe the desire to form sexual relationships with animals, and the latter to describe the sex acts alone. Confusing the matter yet further, writing in 1962, Masters used the term bestialist specifically in his discussion of zoosadism.\\nStephanie LaFarge, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the New Jersey Medical School, and Director of Counseling at the ASPCA, writes that two groups can be distinguished: bestialists, who rape or abuse animals, and zoophiles, who form an emotional and sexual attachment to animals. Colin J. Williams and Martin Weinberg studied self-defined zoophiles via the internet and reported them as understanding the term zoophilia to involve concern for the animal\\'s welfare, pleasure, and consent, as distinct from the self-labelled zoophiles\\' concept of \"bestialists\", whom the zoophiles in their study defined as focused on their own gratification. Williams and Weinberg also quoted a British newspaper saying that zoophilia is a term used by \"apologists\" for bestiality.\\n\\n\\n== Extent of occurrence ==\\nThe Kinsey reports rated the percentage of people who had sexual interaction with animals at some point in their lives as 8% for men and 3.6% for women, and claimed it was 40\\xe2\\x80\\x9350% in people living near farms, but some later writers dispute the figures, because the study lacked a random sample in that it included a disproportionate number of prisoners, causing sampling bias. Martin Duberman has written that it is difficult to get a random sample in sexual research, and that even when Paul Gebhard, Kinsey\\'s research successor, removed prison samples from the figures, he found the figures were not significantly changed.\\nBy 1974, the farm population in the USA had declined by 80 percent compared with 1940, reducing the opportunity to live with animals; Hunt\\'s 1974 study suggests that these demographic changes led to a significant change in reported occurrences of bestiality. The percentage of males who reported sexual interactions with animals in 1974 was 4.9% (1948: 8.3%), and in females in 1974 was 1.9% (1953: 3.6%). Miletski believes this is not due to a reduction in interest but merely a reduction in opportunity.\\nNancy Friday\\'s 1973 book on female sexuality, My Secret Garden, comprised around 190 fantasies from different women; of these, 23 involve zoophilic activity.\\nIn one study, psychiatric patients were found to have a statistically significant higher prevalence rate (55 percent) of reported bestiality, both actual sexual contacts (45 percent) and sexual fantasy (30 percent) than the control groups of medical in-patients (10 percent) and psychiatric staff (15 percent). Cr\\xc3\\xa9pault and Couture (1980) reported that 5.3 percent of the men they surveyed had fantasized about sexual activity with an animal during heterosexual intercourse. In a 2014 study, 3% of women and 2.2% of men reported fantasies about having sex with an animal. A 1982 study suggested that 7.5 percent of 186 university students had interacted sexually with an animal.\\n Sexual arousal from watching animals mate is known as faunoiphilia. A frequent interest in and sexual excitement at watching animals mate is cited as an indicator of latent zoophilia by Massen (1994). Sexual fantasies about zoophilic acts can occur in people who do not have any wish to experience them in real life. Nancy Friday notes that zoophilia as a fantasy may provide an escape from cultural expectations, restrictions, and judgements in regard to sex. Masters (1962) says that some brothel madams used to stage exhibitions of animals mating, as they found it aroused potential clientele, and that this may have encouraged the clients to engage in bestiality.. Several studies have found that women show stronger vaginal responses to films depicting bonobo copulation than to non-sexual stimuli.\\n\\n\\n== Perspectives on zoophilia ==\\n\\n\\n=== Research perspectives ===\\nZoophilia has been partly discussed by several sciences: Psychology (the study of the human mind), sexology (a relatively new discipline primarily studying human sexuality), ethology (the study of animal behavior), and anthrozoology (the study of human-animal interactions and bonds).\\nThe nature of animal minds, animal mental processes and structures, and animal self-awareness, perception, emotion in animals, and \"map of the world\", are studied within animal cognition and also explored within various specialized branches of neuroscience such as neuroethology.\\nIn the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), zoophilia is placed in the classification \"other specified paraphilic disorder\" (\"paraphilias not otherwise specified\" in the DSM-III and IV). The World Health Organization takes the same position, listing a sexual preference for animals in its ICD-10 as \"other disorder of sexual preference\". In the DSM-5, it rises to the level of a diagnosable disorder only when accompanied by distress or interference with normal functioning.\\nZoophilia may also be covered to some degree by other fields such as ethics, philosophy, law, animal rights and animal welfare. It may also be touched upon by sociology which looks both at zoosadism in examining patterns and issues related to sexual abuse and at non-sexual zoophilia in examining the role of animals as emotional support and companionship in human lives, and may fall within the scope of psychiatry if it becomes necessary to consider its significance in a clinical context. The Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine (Vol. 18, February 2011) states that sexual contact with animals is almost never a clinically significant problem by itself; it also states that there are several kinds of zoophiles:\\nAdditionally, zoophiles in categories 2, 3, and 8 (romantic zoophiles, zoophilic fantasizers, and regular zoophiles) are the most common, while zoophiles found in categories 6 and 7 (sadistic bestials and opportunistic zoophiles) are the least common.\\nZoophilia may reflect childhood experimentation, sexual abuse or lack of other avenues of sexual expression. Exclusive desire for animals rather than humans is considered a rare paraphilia, and sufferers often have other paraphilias with which they present. Zoophiles will not usually seek help for their condition, and so do not come to the attention of psychiatrists for zoophilia itself.\\nThe first detailed studies of zoophilia date from prior to 1910. Peer reviewed research into zoophilia in its own right started around 1960. However, a number of the most oft-quoted studies, such as Miletski, were not published in peer-reviewed journals. There have been several significant modern books, from Masters (1962) to Beetz (2002); their research arrived at the following conclusions:\\n\\nMost zoophiles have (or have also had) long term human relationships as well or at the same time as zoosexual ones, and that zoosexual partners are usually dogs and/or horses (Masters, Miletski, Beetz)\\nZoophiles\\' emotions and care for animals can be real, relational, authentic and (within animals\\' abilities) reciprocal, and not just a substitute or means of expression. Beetz believes zoophilia is not an inclination which is chosen.\\nSociety in general at present is considerably misinformed about zoophilia, its stereotypes, and its meaning. The distinction between zoophilia and zoosadism is a critical one to these researchers, and is highlighted by each of these studies. Masters (1962), Miletski (1999) and Weinberg (2003) each comment significantly on the social harm caused by misunderstandings regarding zoophilia: \"This destroy[s] the lives of many citizens\".\\n\\nBeetz also states the following:\\n\\n\"The phenomenon of sexual contact with animals is starting to lose its taboo: it is appearing more often in scholarly publications, and the public are being confronted with it, too.[...] Sexual contact with animals \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the form of bestiality or zoophilia \\xe2\\x80\\x93 needs to be discussed more openly and investigated in more detail by scholars working in disciplines such as animal ethics, animal behavior, anthrozoology, psychology, mental health, sociology, and the law.\"\\n\\nMore recently, research has engaged three further directions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the speculation that at least some animals seem to enjoy a zoophilic relationship assuming sadism is not present, and can form an affectionate bond. Similar findings are also reported by Kinsey (cited by Masters), and others earlier in history. Miletski (1999) notes that information on sex with animals on the internet is often very emphatic as to what the zoophile believes gives pleasure and how to identify what is perceived as consent beforehand. For instance, Jonathan Balcombe says animals do things for pleasure. But he himself says pet owners will be unimpressed by this statement, as this is not news to them.\\nBeetz described the phenomenon of zoophilia/bestiality as being somewhere between crime, paraphilia and love, although she says that most research has been based on criminological reports, so the cases have frequently involved violence and psychiatric illness. She says only a few recent studies have taken data from volunteers in the community. As with all volunteer surveys and sexual ones in particular, these studies have a potential for self-selection bias.\\nMedical research suggests that some zoophiles only become aroused by a specific species (such as horses), some zoophiles become aroused by multiple species (which may or may not include humans), and some zoophiles are not attracted to humans at all.\\nResearchers who observed a monkey trying to mate with a deer in 2017 (interspecies sex) said that it may provide clues into why humans have interspecies sex.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical and cultural perspectives ===\\n\\nInstances of this behavior have been found in the Bible. In a cave painting from at least 8000 BC in the Northern Italian Val Camonica a man is shown about to penetrate an animal. Raymond Christinger interprets that as a show of power of a tribal chief, and so we do not know if this practice was then more acceptable, and if the scene depicted was usual or unusual or whether it was symbolic or imaginary. The Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art says the scene may be humorous, as the penetrating man seems to be waving cheerfully with his hand at the same time. Potters seem to have spent time depicting the practice, but this may be because they found the idea amusing. Dr \"Jacobus X\", said to be a nom-de-plume for a French author, said this was clearly \"before any known taboos against sex with animals existed.\" Marc Epprecht states that authors such as Jacobus X do not deserve respect because their methodology is based on hearsay, and was designed for voyeuristic titillation of the reader. Masters said that since pre-historic man is prehistoric it goes without saying that we know little of his sexual behaviour, depictions in cave paintings may only show the artist\\'s subjective preoccupations or thoughts.\\nPindar, Herodotus, and Plutarch claimed the Egyptians engaged in ritual congress with goats. Such claims about other cultures do not necessarily reflect anything about which the author had evidence, but be a form of propaganda or xenophobia, similar to blood libel.\\nBestiality was accepted in some North American and Middle Eastern indigenous cultures. Sexual intercourse between humans and non-human animals was not uncommon among certain Native American indigenous peoples, including the Hopi. Voget describes the sexual lives of young Native Americans as \"rather inclusive,\" including bestiality. In addition, the Copper Inuit people had \"no aversion to intercourse with live animals\".\\nSeveral cultures built temples (Khajuraho, India) or other structures (Sagaholm, barrow, Sweden) with zoophilic carvings on the exterior, however at Khajuraho these depictions are not on the interior, perhaps depicting that these are things that belong to the profane world rather than the spiritual world, and thus are to be left outside.\\nIn the Church-oriented culture of the Middle Ages zoophilic activity was met with execution, typically burning, and death to the animals involved either the same way or by hanging, as \"both a violation of Biblical edicts and a degradation of man as a spiritual being rather than one that is purely animal and carnal.\" Some witches were accused of having congress with the devil in the form of an animal. As with all accusations and confessions extracted under torture in the witch trials in Early Modern Europe, their validity cannot be ascertained.\\n\\n\\n=== Religious perspectives ===\\nPassages in Leviticus 18 (Lev 18:23: \"And you shall not lie with any beast and defile yourself with it, neither shall any woman give herself to a beast to lie with it: it is a perversion.\" RSV) and 20:15\\xe2\\x80\\x9316 (\"If a man lies with a beast, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the beast. If a woman approaches any beast and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.\" RSV) are cited by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theologians as categorical denunciation of bestiality. However, the teachings of the New Testament have been interpreted by some as not expressly forbidding bestiality.\\nIn Part II of his Summa Theologica, medieval philosopher Thomas Aquinas ranked various \"unnatural vices\" (sex acts resulting in \"venereal pleasure\" rather than procreation) by degrees of sinfulness, concluding that \"the most grievous is the sin of bestiality.\" Some Christian theologians extend Matthew\\'s view that even having thoughts of adultery is sinful to imply that thoughts of committing bestial acts are likewise sinful.\\n\\nThere are a few references in Hindu scriptures to religious figures engaging in symbolic sexual activity with animals such as explicit depictions of people having sex with animals included amongst the thousands of sculptures of \"Life events\" on the exterior of the temple complex at Khajuraho. The depictions are largely symbolic depictions of the sexualization of some animals and are not meant to be taken literally. According to the Hindu tradition of erotic painting and sculpture, having sex with an animal is believed to be actually a human having sex with a God incarnated in the form of an animal. However, the Hindu scriptures like the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana having sex with animals, especially the cow, leads one to Hell, where the person is tormented by rubbing their bodies on trees with razor-sharp thorns.\\n\\n\\n== Legal status ==\\n\\nIn many jurisdictions, all forms of zoophilic acts are prohibited; others outlaw only the mistreatment of animals, without specific mention of sexual activity. In the United Kingdom, Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (also known as the Extreme Pornography Act) outlaws images of a person performing or appearing to perform an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive). Despite the UK Ministry of Justice\\'s explanatory note on extreme images saying \"It is not a question of the intentions of those who produced the image. Nor is it a question of the sexual arousal of the defendant\", \"it could be argued that a person might possess such an image for the purposes of satire, political commentary or simple grossness,\" according to The Independent. Countries such as Belgium and Sweden are somewhere in between: they permit sexual activity with animals, but prohibit the promotion of animal-oriented pornography.\\nMany new laws banning sex with animals have been made recently, such as in New Hampshire, Ohio, Germany, Sweden, Denmark,Thailand, Costa Rica, Bolivia, and Guatemala. The number of jurisdictions around the world banning it has grown in the 2000s and 2010s.\\nLaws on zoophilia are sometimes triggered by specific incidents. While some laws are very specific, others employ vague terms such as \"sodomy\" or \"bestiality\", which lack legal precision and leave it unclear exactly which acts are covered. In the past, some bestiality laws may have been made in the belief that sex with an animal could result in monstrous offspring, as well as offending the community. Current anti-cruelty laws focus more specifically on animal welfare while anti-bestiality laws are aimed only at offenses to community \"standards\". Notable legal views include Sweden, where a 2005 report by the Swedish Animal Welfare Agency for the government expressed concern over the increase in reports of horse-ripping incidents. The agency believed current animal cruelty legislation was not sufficient in protecting animals from abuse and needed updating, but concluded that on balance it was not appropriate to call for a ban. In New Zealand, the 1989 Crimes Bill considered abolishing bestiality as a criminal offense, and instead viewing it as a mental health issue, but they did not, and people can still be prosecuted for it. Under Section 143 of the Crimes Act 1961, individuals can serve a sentence of seven years duration for animal sexual abuse and the offence is considered \\'complete\\' in the event of \\'penetration\\'. In Canada a clarification of the anti-bestiality law was made in 2016 which legalizes most forms of sexual contact with animals other than penetration.\\nSome countries once had laws against single males living with female animals, such as Alpacas. Copulating with a female alpaca is still specifically against the law in Peru.\\nAs of 2017, bestiality is illegal in 45 U.S. states. Most state bestiality laws were enacted between 1999 and 2017. Until 2005, there was a farm near Enumclaw, Washington that was described as an \\xe2\\x80\\x9canimal brothel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, where people paid to have sex with animals. After an incident on 2 July 2005, when a man was pronounced dead in the emergency room of the Enumclaw community hospital after his colon ruptured due to having been sodomized by a horse, the farm garnered police attention. The state legislature of the State of Washington, which had been one of the few states in the United States without a law against bestiality, within six months passed a bill making bestiality illegal. Arizona, Alaska, Florida, Alabama, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Ohio, Texas, Vermont, and Nevada have banned sex with animals between 2006 and the present, with the latter 5 all banning it in 2017. When such laws are proposed, they are never questioned or debated. Laws which prohibit non-abusive bestiality have been criticized for being discriminatory, unjust and unconstitutional.\\n\\n\\n=== Pornography ===\\n\\nPornography involving sex with animals is widely illegal, even in most countries where bestiality itself is not explicitly outlawed.\\nIn the United States, zoophilic pornography would be considered obscene if it did not meet the standards of the Miller Test and therefore is not openly sold, mailed, distributed or imported across state boundaries or within states which prohibit it. Under U.S. law, \\'distribution\\' includes transmission across the Internet. Production and mere possession appears to be legal, however. U.S. prohibitions on distribution of sexual or obscene materials are as of 2005 in some doubt, having been ruled unconstitutional in United States v. Extreme Associates (a judgement which was overturned on appeal, December 2005).\\nSimilar restrictions apply in Germany (see above). In New Zealand the possession, making or distribution of material promoting bestiality is illegal.\\nThe potential use of media for pornographic movies was seen from the start of the era of silent film. Polissons and Galipettes (re-released 2002 as \"The Good Old Naughty Days\") is a collection of early French silent films for brothel use, including some animal pornography, dating from around 1905 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1930.\\nMaterial featuring sex with animals is widely available on the Internet, due to their ease of production, and because production and sale is legal in countries such as Denmark. Prior to the advent of mass-market magazines such as Playboy, so-called Tijuana Bibles were a form of pornographic tract popular in America, sold as anonymous underground publications typically comprising a small number of stapled comic-strips representing characters and celebrities. The promotion of \"stars\" began with the Danish Bodil Joensen, in the period of 1969\\xe2\\x80\\x9372, along with other porn actors such as the Americans Linda Lovelace (Dogarama, 1969), Chessie Moore (multiple films, c. 1994), Kerri Downs (three films, 1998) and Calina Lynx (aka Kelly G\\'raffe) (two films, 1998). Another early film to attain great infamy was \"Animal Farm\", smuggled into Great Britain around 1980 without details as to makers or provenance. The film was later traced to a crude juxtaposition of smuggled cuts from many of Bodil Joensen\\'s 1970s Danish movies.\\nInto the 1980s the Dutch took the lead, creating figures like \"Wilma\" and the \"Dutch Sisters\". In the 1980s, \"bestiality\" was featured in Italian adult films with actresses like Denise Dior, Francesca Ray, and Marina Hedman, manifested early in the softcore flick Bestialit\\xc3\\xa0 in 1976.\\nToday, in Hungary, where production faces no legal limitations, zoophilic materials have become a substantial industry that produces numerous films and magazines, particularly for Dutch companies such as Topscore and Book & Film International, and the genre has stars such as \"Hector\", a Great Dane starring in several films. Many Hungarian mainstream performers also appeared anonymously in animal pornography in their early careers. For example, Suzy Spark.\\nIn Japan, animal pornography is used to bypass censorship laws, often featuring Japanese and Swedish female models performing fellatio on animals, because oral penetration of a non-human penis is not in the scope of Japanese mosaic censor. Sakura Sakurada is an AV idol known to have appeared in animal pornography, specifically in the AV The Dog Game in 2006. While primarily underground, there are a number of animal pornography actresses who specialize in bestiality movies. A box-office success of the 1980s, 24 Horas de Sexo Expl\\xc3\\xadcito featured zoophilia.\\nIn the UK Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 criminalises possession of realistic pornographic images depicting sex with animals (see extreme pornography), including fake images and simulated acts, as well as images depicting sex with dead animals, where no crime has taken place in the production. The law provides for sentences of up to two years in prison; a sentence of 12 months was handed down in one case in 2011.\\nPornography of this sort has become the business of certain spammers such as Jeremy Jaynes and owners of some fake TGPs, who use the promise of \"extreme\" material as a bid for users\\' attention.\\n\\n\\n== Health and safety ==\\n\\nInfections that are transmitted from animals to humans are called zoonoses. Some zoonoses may be transferred through casual contact, but others are much more readily transferred by activities that expose humans to the semen, vaginal fluids, urine, saliva, feces and blood of animals. Examples of zoonoses are Brucellosis, Q fever, leptospirosis, and toxocariasis. Therefore, sexual activity with animals is, in some instances, a high risk activity. Allergic reactions to animal semen may occur, including anaphylaxis. Bites and other trauma from penetration or trampling may occur.\\n\\n\\n== Zoophiles ==\\n\\n\\n=== Non-sexual zoophilia ===\\nThe love of animals is not necessarily sexual in nature. In psychology and sociology the word \"zoophilia\" is sometimes used without sexual implications. Being fond of animals in general, or as pets, is accepted in Western society, and is usually respected or tolerated. However, the word zoophilia is used to mean a sexual preference towards animals, which makes it  a paraphilia. Some zoophiles may not act on their sexual attraction to animals. People who identify as zoophiles may feel their love for animals is romantic rather than purely sexual, and say this makes them different from those committing entirely sexually motivated acts of bestiality.\\n\\n\\n=== Zoophile community ===\\n\\nAn online survey which recruited participants over the internet concluded that prior to the arrival of widespread computer networking, most zoophiles would not have known other zoophiles, and for the most part, zoophiles engaged in bestiality secretly, or told only trusted friends, family or partners. The internet and its predecessors made people able to search for information on topics which were not otherwise easily accessible and to communicate with relative safety and anonymity. Because of the diary-like intimacy of blogs and the anonymity of the internet, zoophiles had the ideal opportunity to \"openly\" express their sexuality. As with many other alternate lifestyles, broader networks began forming in the 1980s when participating in networked social groups became more common at home and elsewhere. Such developments in general were described by Markoff in 1990; the linking of computers meant that people thousands of miles apart could feel the intimacy akin to being in a small village together. The popular newsgroup alt.sex.bestiality, said to be in the top 1% of newsgroup interest (i.e. number 50 out of around 5000), \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and reputedly started in humor \\xe2\\x80\\x93 along with personal bulletin boards and talkers, chief among them Sleepy\\'s multiple worlds, Lintilla, and Planes of Existence, were among the first group media of this kind in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These groups rapidly drew together zoophiles, some of whom also created personal and social websites and internet forums. By around 1992\\xe2\\x80\\x931994, the wide social net had evolved. This was initially centered around the above-mentioned newsgroup, alt.sex.bestiality, which during the six years following 1990 had matured into a discussion and support group. The newsgroup included information about health issues, laws governing zoophilia, bibliography relating to the subject, and community events. Since the 1990s, other zoophile websites have been created and have grown in size; for example, the zoophile website and internet forum \"beastforum.com\" has more than one million members as of March 2012.\\nWeinberg and Williams observe that the internet can socially integrate an incredibly large number of people. In Kinsey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s day contacts between animal lovers were more localized and limited to male compatriots in a particular rural community. Further, while the farm boys Kinsey researched might have been part of a rural culture in which sex with animals was a part, the sex itself did not define the community. The zoophile community is not known to be particularly large compared to other subcultures which make use of the internet, so Weinberg and Williams surmised its aims and beliefs would likely change little as it grew. Those particularly active on the internet may not be aware of a wider subculture, as there is not much of a wider subculture, Weinberg and Williams felt the virtual zoophile group would lead the development of the subculture.\\nThere also exist websites which aim to provide support and social assistance to zoophiles (including resources to help and rescue abused or mistreated animals), but these are not usually well publicized. Such work is often undertaken as needed by individuals and friends, within social networks, and by word of mouth. One notable early attempt at creating a zoophile support structure focused on social and psychological support was the newsgroup soc.support.zoophilia, which was proposed in 1994 but narrowly failed to meet the 2/3 majority needed to be created. There was also a German support group called \"Interessengemeinschaft Zoophiler Menschen (\"Zoophile Interest Group\").\\nZoophiles tend to experience their first zoosexual feelings during adolescence, and tend to be secretive about it, hence limiting the ability for non-Internet communities to form:\\n\\n\"I asked him [a zoophile] when he had his first inkling of being a zoophile. \\'When you\\'re a kid, you\\'re not really aware of too much sexually,\\' he says. \\'But I was always interested in animals, starting around age 10. It was an extension of my affection for the dog and of my discovery of sex. He\\'s a male. I\\'m a male. I wanted to make him feel good.\\' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. \\'For years, I thought I was the only one who did this,\\' James says. \\'I felt like there was no one I could talk to about this. I definitely knew I wasn\\'t going to be talking to my parents or my friends about this.\\'[...] \\'This is not a fetish,\\' James says of his attractions. \\'It\\'s an orientation, a lifestyle.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n== Debate over zoophilia or zoophilic relations ==\\n\\nBecause of its controversial nature, people have developed arguments both for and against zoophilia. Arguments for and against zoosexual activity from a variety of sources, including religious, moral, ethical, psychological, medical and social.\\n\\n\\n=== Arguments against bestiality ===\\nBestiality is seen by the government of the United Kingdom as profoundly disturbed behavior (as indicated by the UK Home Office review on sexual offences in 2002). Andrea Beetz states there is evidence that there can be violent zoosadistic approaches to sex with animals. Beetz argues that animals might be traumatized even by a non-violent, sexual approach from a human; however, Beetz also says that in some cases, non-abusive bestiality can be reciprocally pleasurable for both the human and non-human animal.\\nAn argument from human dignity is given by Wesley J. Smith, a senior fellow and Intelligent Design proponent at the Center for Science and Culture of the conservative Christian Discovery Institute: \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"such behavior is profoundly degrading and utterly subversive to the crucial understanding that human beings are unique, special, and of the highest moral worth in the known universe\\xe2\\x80\\x94a concept known as \\'human exceptionalism\\' ... one of the reasons bestiality is condemned through law is that such degrading conduct unacceptably subverts standards of basic human dignity and is an affront to humankind\\'s inestimable importance and intrinsic moral worth.\"\\nOne of the primary critiques of bestiality is that it is harmful to animals and necessarily abusive, because animals are unable to give or withhold consent.\\nThe Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) has said that as animals do not have the same capacity for thinking as humans, they are unable to give full consent. The HSUS takes the position that all sexual activity between humans and animals is abusive, whether it involves physical injury or not. In his 1993 article, Dr. Frank Ascione stated that \"bestiality may be considered abusive even in cases when physical harm to an animal does not occur.\" In a 1997 article, Piers Beirne, Professor of Criminology at the University of Southern Maine, points out that \\'for genuine consent to sexual relations to be present...both participants must be conscious, fully informed and positive in their desires.\\'\\n\\n\\n=== Arguments for bestiality ===\\n\\nSome defenders of bestiality argue that the issue of sexual consent is irrelevant because many legal human practices (such as semen collection, artificial insemination, hunting, laboratory testing, and slaughtering animals for meat) do not involve the consent of the animal. Brian Cutteridge states the following regarding this argument:\\n\\n\"Animal sexual autonomy is regularly violated for human financial gain through procedures such as [artificial insemination and slaughter]. Such procedures are probably more disturbing physically and psychologically than acts of zoophilia would be, yet the issue of consent on the part of the animal is never raised in the discussion of such procedures. To confine the \\'right\\' of any animal strictly to acts of zoophilia is thus to make a law [against zoophilia] based not on reason but on moral prejudice, and to breach the constitutional rights of zoophiles to due process and equality before the law. [...] Laws which criminalize zoophilia based on societal abhorrence of such acts rather than any real harm caused by such acts are an unjust and unconstitutional infringement on individual liberty.\"\\n\\nMiletski believes that \"Animals are capable of sexual consent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and even initiation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in their own way.\" It is not an uncommon practice for dogs to attempt to copulate with (\"hump\") the legs of people of both genders. Rosenberger (1968) emphasizes that as far as cunnilingus is concerned, dogs require no training, and even Dekkers (1994) and Menninger (1951) admit that sometimes animals take the initiative and do so impulsively. Those supporting zoophilic activity feel animals sometimes even seem to enjoy the sexual attention or voluntarily initiate sexual activity with humans. Animals such as dogs can be willing participants in sexual activity with humans, and \"seem to enjoy the attention provided by the sexual interaction with a human.\" Animal owners normally know what their own pets like or do not like. Most people can tell if an animal does not like how it is being petted, because it will move away. An animal that is liking being petted pushes against the hand, and seems to enjoy it. To those defending bestiality this is seen as a way in which animals give consent, or the fact that a dog might wag its tail.\\nUtilitarian philosopher and animal liberation author Peter Singer argues that bestiality is not unethical so long as it involves no harm or cruelty to the animal (see Harm principle). In the article \"Heavy Petting,\" Singer argues that zoosexual activity need not be abusive, and that relationships could form which were mutually enjoyed. Singer and others have argued that people\\'s dislike of bestiality is partly caused by irrational speciesism and anthropocentrism. Because interspecies sex occurs in nature, and because humans are animals, supporters argue that zoosexual activity is not \"unnatural\" and is not intrinsically wrong.\\nResearch has proven that non-human animals can and do have sex for non-reproductive purposes (and for pleasure). In 2006, a Danish Animal Ethics Council report concluded that ethically performed zoosexual activity is capable of providing a positive experience for all participants, and that some non-human animals are sexually attracted to humans (for example, dolphins).\\nSome zoophiles claim that they are not abusive towards animals:\\n\\n\"In other recent surveys, the majority of zoophiles scoffed at the notion that they were abusive toward animals in any way\\xe2\\x80\\x94far from it, they said. Many even consider themselves to be animal welfare advocates in addition to zoophiles.\"\\n\\n\\n== Mentions in the media ==\\nBecause of its controversial nature, different countries vary in the discussion of bestiality. Often sexual matters are the subject of legal or regulatory requirement. In 2005 the UK broadcasting regulator (OFCOM) updated its code stating that freedom of expression is at the heart of any democratic state. Adult audiences should be informed as to what they will be viewing or hearing, and the young, who cannot make a fully informed choice for themselves, should be protected. Hence a watershed and other precautions were set up for explicit sexual material, to protect young people. Zoophile activity and other sexual matters may be discussed, but only in an appropriate context and manner.\\nThe IPT was replaced after the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act in 1993, replaced with bodies designed to allow both more debate and increased consistency, and possession and supply of material that it is decided are objectionable was made a criminal offence.\\nMention in the media is often comical in nature. References to bestiality are not uncommon in some media, especially adult cartoon series such as Family Guy and South Park, satirical comedy such as Borat, and films (especially shock exploitation films), although a few broadcasters such as Howard Stern (who joked about bestiality dial-a-date on NBC) and Tom Binns (whose XFM London Breakfast Show resulted on one occasion in a live discussion about the ethics of zoophilic pornographic movies at peak child listening time) have been reprimanded by their stations for doing so.\\nIn literature, American novelist Kurt Vonnegut refers to a photo of a woman attempting sexual intercourse with a Shetland Pony in The Sirens of Titan, Slaughterhouse Five, and God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater. Philip K. Dick also refers to a photo of a woman copulating with a Shetland Pony in Flow My Tears The Policeman Said. John Irving\\'s novel The Cider House Rules repeatedly mentions a pornographic photograph depicting oral sex on a pony. In Clerks II Randal orders a donkey show as a going away present for his best friend Dante, in which it is referred to as \"interspecies erotica\" by the male performer.\\nPu Songling refers to zoophilia in the Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio short story \"The Fornicating Dog\", which talks about sexual relations between a woman and her white dog.\\n\\n\\n== Books, articles and documentaries about zoophilia ==\\n\\n\\n=== Academic and professional ===\\nAndrea Beetz PhD: Bestiality and Zoophilia (2005), ISBN 978-1-55753-412-5\\nAndrea Beetz PhD: Love, Violence, and Sexuality in Relationships between Humans and Animals (2002), ISBN 978-3-8322-0020-6\\nDoron S.

       "       [b'Zucchini (, American English) or courgette (, British English) is a summer squash which can reach nearly a metre in length, but is usually harvested immature at 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in). In Britain and Ireland a fully grown zucchini is referred to as a marrow.\\nAlong with certain other squashes and pumpkins, it belongs to the species Cucurbita pepo. Zucchini can be dark or light green. A related hybrid, the golden zucchini, is a deep yellow or orange color.\\nIn a culinary context, zucchini is treated as a vegetable; it is usually cooked and presented as a savory dish or accompaniment. Botanically, zucchinis are fruits, a type of botanical berry called a \"pepo\", being the swollen ovary of the zucchini flower.\\nZucchini, like all squash, has its ancestry in the Americas. However, the varieties of squash typically called \"zucchini\" were developed in northern Italy in the second half of the 19th century, many generations after the introduction of cucurbits from the Americas in the early 16th century.\\n\\n\\n== Name ==\\n\\nIn the United States, Australia and Germany, the plant is commonly called a zucchini ( ( listen); plural: zucchini or zucchinis), from Italian: zucchina [dzuk\\xcb\\x88ki\\xcb\\x90na] (plural: zucchine), diminutive of zucca, \"gourd, marrow, pumpkin, squash\".\\nThe name courgette (French pronunciation: \\xe2\\x80\\x8b[ku\\xca\\x81.\\xca\\x92\\xc9\\x9bt]) is a French loan word, the diminutive of courge, \"gourd, marrow\", and is commonly used in France, Belgium and other Francophone areas, and in the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Scandinavia, the Netherlands and South Africa.\\nIn the United Kingdom, Ireland and New Zealand, a fully-grown, matured courgette is referred to as a marrow. Most marrow cultivars sold in the UK are striped. In South Africa, the fruit is typically harvested as a baby vegetable, approximately finger size, and is referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbaby marrows\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\n\\n\\n== Flower ==\\n\\nThe female flower is a golden blossom on the end of each emergent zucchini. The male flower grows directly on the stem of the zucchini plant in the leaf axils (where leaf petiole meets stem), on a long stalk, and is slightly smaller than the female. Both flowers are edible and are often used to dress a meal or to garnish the cooked fruit.\\nFirm and fresh blossoms that are only slightly open are cooked to be eaten, with pistils removed from female flowers, and stamens removed from male flowers. The stems on the flowers can be retained as a way of giving the cook something to hold onto during cooking, rather than injuring the delicate petals, or they can be removed prior to cooking, or prior to serving. There are a variety of recipes in which the flowers may be deep fried as fritters or tempura (after dipping in a light tempura batter), stuffed, saut\\xc3\\xa9ed, baked, or used in soups.\\n\\n\\n== History and etymology ==\\nZucchini, like all squash, has its ancestry in the Americas. However, the varieties of green, cylindrical squash harvested immature and typically called \"zucchini\" were developed in northern Italy, long after the introduction of cucurbits from the Americas. It appears that this occurred in the second half of the 19th century, though the first description of the variety under the name zucchini occurs in a work published in Milan in 1901; early varieties usually appended the names of nearby cities in their names.\\nThe word zucchini and this culinary variety of C. pepo arose independently and simultaneously in 19th-century Tuscany and northern Italy. Zucca is the Italian word for pumpkin/squash and zucchino/zucchina (zucca + ina = little) are diminutive forms, becoming zucchini/zucchine in the plural. Zucchino, the masculine form (zucchini in the plural), is the first form to be documented in writing. An Italian dictionary called lo Zingarelli 2015, Zanichelli Editore, gives both forms, as does the Devoto-Oli published by Le Monnier, but the Accademia della Crusca, the most important research institution on Italian language, defines zucchino as the preferable form. The Treccani, Istituto dell\\'Enciclopedia italiana, another highly respected linguistic authority, gives zucchina as the main Italian word, and the masculine form as Tuscan dialect. Zucchini is used in Italy, Australia, Canada, Germany, Sweden and the United States. Zucchini is one of the plural forms in English (along with zucchinis), as well as the singular form.\\nThe first records of zucchini in the United States date to the early 1920s. It was almost certainly taken to America by Italian immigrants and probably was first cultivated in the United States in California. A 1928 report on vegetables grown in New York State treats \\'Zucchini\\' as one among 60 cultivated varieties of C. pepo.\\n\\n\\n== Culinary uses ==\\n\\nWhen used for food, zucchini are usually picked when under 20 cm (8 in) in length, when the seeds are still soft and immature. Mature zucchini can be a metre long or more. The larger ones are often fibrous. A zucchini with the flowers attached is a sign of a truly fresh and immature fruit, and it is especially sought after for its sweeter flavor.\\nUnlike cucumber, zucchini is usually served cooked. It can be prepared using a variety of cooking techniques, including steamed, boiled, grilled, stuffed and baked, barbecued, fried, or incorporated in other recipes such as souffl\\xc3\\xa9s. Zucchini can also be baked into a bread similar to banana bread or incorporated into a cake mix. Its flowers can be eaten stuffed and are a delicacy when deep fried, as tempura.\\n\\nZucchini has a delicate flavor and requires little more than quick cooking with butter or olive oil, with or without fresh herbs. The skin is left in place. Quick cooking of barely wet zucchini in oil or butter allows the fruit to partially boil and steam, with the juices concentrated in the final moments of frying when the water has gone, prior to serving. Zucchini can also be eaten raw, sliced or shredded, in a cold salad, as well as lightly cooked in hot salads, as in Thai or Vietnamese recipes. Mature (larger sized) zucchini are well suited for cooking in breads. Zucchinis can be cut with a spiralizer to make zucchini noodles for low-carbohydrate recipes.\\nIn Bulgaria, zucchini may be fried and then served with a dip, made from yogurt, garlic, and dill. Another popular dish is oven-baked zucchini\\xe2\\x80\\x94sliced or grated\\xe2\\x80\\x94covered with a mixture of eggs, yogurt, flour, and dill.\\nIn Egypt, zucchini may be cooked with tomato sauce, garlic, and onions.\\nIn France, zucchini is a key ingredient in ratatouille, a stew of summer fruits and vegetables prepared in olive oil and cooked for an extended time over low heat. The dish, originating near present-day Nice, is served as a side dish or on its own at lunch with bread. Zucchini may be stuffed with meat or with other fruits such as tomatoes or bell peppers in a dish called courgette farcie (stuffed zucchini).\\nIn Greece, zucchini is usually fried or stewed with other fruits (often green chili peppers and eggplants). It is served as an hors d\\'\\xc5\\x93uvre or as a main dish, especially during fasting seasons. Zucchini is also stuffed with minced meat, rice, and herbs and served with avgolemono sauce. In several parts of Greece, the flowers of the plant are stuffed with white cheese, usually feta or mizithra cheese, or with a mixture of rice, herbs, and occasionally minced meat. They are then deep-fried or baked in the oven with tomato sauce.\\nIn Italy, zucchini is served in a variety of ways: fried, baked, boiled, or deep fried, alone or in combination with other ingredients. At home and in some restaurants, it is possible to eat the flowers, as well, deep-fried, known as fiori di zucca. (cf. Pumpkin flower fritter)\\nIn Levantine countries such as Palestine, Jordan, and Lebanon, zucchini is stuffed with minced meat and rice plus herbs and spices. The dish, called \\xd9\\x85\\xd8\\xad\\xd8\\xb4\\xd9\\x8a (mahshi), is then boiled in tomato based sauce, commonly cooked with \\xd9\\x88\\xd8\\xb1\\xd9\\x82 \\xd8\\xaf\\xd9\\x88\\xd8\\xa7\\xd9\\x84\\xd9\\x8a (warak dwali; stuffed grape leaves). It is served with yogurt or laban. Zucchini is also used in various kinds of stew. Stews that have low salinity are favorable in such cooking.\\nIn Mexico, the flower (known as flor de calabaza) is often cooked in soups or used as a filling for quesadillas. The fruit is used in stews, soups (i.e. caldo de res, de pollo, or de pescado, mole de olla, etc.) and other preparations. The flower, as well as the fruit, is eaten often throughout Latin America.\\nIn Russia, Ukraine and other CIS countries, zucchini usually is coated in flour or semolina and then fried or baked in vegetable oil, served with a sour cream. Another popular recipe is zucchini caviar, the squash spread made from thermically processed zucchini, carrots, onions and tomato paste, produced either homemade or industrially as a vegetable preserves.\\nIn Turkey, zucchini is the main ingredient in the popular dish m\\xc3\\xbccver, or \"zucchini pancakes\", made from shredded zucchini, flour, and eggs, lightly fried in olive oil and eaten with yogurt. They are also often used in kebabs along with various meats. The flowers are also used in a cold dish, where they are stuffed with a rice mix with various spices and nuts and stewed.\\nIn 2005, a poll of 2,000 people revealed zucchini (courgette) to be Britain\\'s 10th favorite culinary vegetable.\\n\\n\\n=== Stuffed zucchini ===\\n\\nStuffed zucchini is found in many cuisines. Typical stuffings in the Middle Eastern family of dolma include rice, onions, tomato, and sometimes meat.\\n\\n\\n== Nutrition ==\\n\\nZucchini are low in food energy (approximately 71 kilojoules or 17 kilocalories per 100 g fresh zucchini) and contain useful amounts of folate (24 \\xce\\xbcg/100 g), potassium (261 mg/100 g) and provitamin A (200 IU [10 RAE]/100 g). Zucchini can be shaped into noodle-like spirals and used as a low-carb substitute for pasta.\\n\\n\\n== Toxicology ==\\nMembers of the plant family Cucurbitacea, which includes zucchini/marrows, pumpkins and cucumbers, can contain toxins called cucurbitacins. These are chemically classified as steroids; they defend the plants from predators, and have a bitter taste to humans. Cultivated cucurbitaceae are bred for low levels of the toxin and are safe to eat. However, ornamental pumpkins can have high levels of cucurbitacins, and such ornamental plants can cross-fertilize edible cucurbitaceae\\xe2\\x80\\x94any such cross-fertilized seeds used by the gardener for growing food in the following season can therefore potentially produce bitter and toxic fruit. Also, dry weather conditions/irregular watering can stress the plant and favor the production of the toxin. The toxin is not destroyed by cooking. Humans with an impaired sense of taste (particularly among the elderly) should therefore ask a younger person to taste the zucchini for them.\\nIn August 2015, a 79-year-old German man and his wife ate a zucchini grown by a neighbor. The couple noted the unusually bitter taste. Shortly afterwards they were both admitted to Heidenheim hospital, apparently with symptoms of a gastrointestinal infection. The wife, who had eaten a smaller portion, survived, while the man died. Toxicological analysis of the meal confirmed the presence of cucurbitacin. Investigators warned that gardeners should not save their own seeds, as reversion to forms containing more poisonous cucurbitacin might occur.\\n\\n\\n== Cultivation ==\\nZucchini is very easy to cultivate in temperate climates. As such, it has a reputation among home gardeners for overwhelming production. The part harvested as \"zucchini\" is the immature fruit, though the flowers, mature fruit, and leaves are eaten as well. One good way to control overabundance is to harvest the flowers, which are an expensive delicacy in markets because of the difficulty in storing and transporting them. The male flower is borne on the end of a stalk and is longer-lived.\\nWhile easy to grow, zucchini, like all squash, requires plentiful bees for pollination. In areas of pollinator decline or high pesticide use, such as mosquito-spray districts, gardeners often experience fruit abortion, where the fruit begins to grow, then dries or rots. This is due to an insufficient number of pollen grains delivered to the female flower. It can be corrected by hand pollination or by increasing the bee population.\\nClosely related to zucchini are Lebanese summer squash or kusa (not to be confused with cushaw), but they often are lighter green or even white. Some seed catalogs do not distinguish them. Various varieties of round zucchinis are grown in different countries under different names, such as \"Tondo di Piacenza\" in Italy and \"Ronde de Nice\" in France. In the late 1990s, American producers in California cultivated and began marketing round yellow and green zucchini known as \"8-ball\" squash (the yellow ones are sometimes known as \"1-ball\" or \"gold ball\"). White zucchini (summer squash) is sometimes seen as a mutation and can appear on the same plant as its green counterpart.\\n\\n\\n== Records ==\\nThe longest zucchini was 2.52 m (8 ft 3 in) long and was grown by Giovanni Batista Scozzafava (Italy) in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, as measured on 28 August 2014.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nKorean zucchini\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nITIS 22365 at the Wayback Machine (archived December 2, 2007), The Integrated Taxonomic Information System, 6 November 2002.
