"""Forecast scheduling for animated `hyp.plot(..., predict=...)` calls.

A forecast used to be a fixed overlay drawn once, so `predict=` refused every
animate mode that reveals data over time. Animating STATIC data (every
observation known up front, merely revealed frame by frame) means every
forecast the animation will ever draw is knowable up front too -- so this
module computes the whole schedule BEFORE drawing, folds it into the display
bounding box, and lets each frame be a table lookup.

Three spaces, never conflated (see the plan's Contract 2):

- ANALYZE space  -- `xform` post normalize/reduce/align, pre-resample,
                    pre-centre/scale. Forecasts are computed HERE, and `t` is
                    measured in these RAW samples.
- FRAME GRID     -- `plot._interp_anim_line` resamples every animated line
                    dataset to exactly `round(frame_rate * duration)` rows.
- DISPLAY box    -- the centred/rescaled [-1, 1] cube (`plot.py:4568-4585`).

def forecast_from_history(history, model, t, min_history=DEFAULT_MIN_HISTORY):
    """Forecast `t` steps on from `history`, as a displacement path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    history : array-like, shape (n_observed, n_dims)
        The trajectory revealed so far, in ANALYZE space (already reduced,
        not yet resampled onto the frame grid and not yet centred/scaled).
    model : str or dict
        Anything `hypertools.predict` accepts ('Kalman', 'ARIMA', 'Laplace',
        'GaussianProcess', 'Chronos', ...).
    t : int
        Forecast horizon, in RAW analyze-space steps. ``t=1`` is the next
        observation.
    min_history : int, default 2
        Refuse to forecast from fewer rows than this.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray or None
        Shape ``(t + 1, n_dims)``, dtype float64. Row 0 is all zeros (the
        anchor itself), so ``history[-1] + result`` is the forecast path in
        analyze space. ``None`` when `history` is shorter than `min_history`
        -- callers must hide the artist rather than draw an empty trace.

    Notes
    -----
    `hypertools.predict` returns a ``pandas.DataFrame``; its index is
    deliberately discarded here (a forecast's index is a continuation the
    plotting code has no use for).
