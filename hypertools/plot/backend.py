"""
Module that deals with managing the matplotlib backend for interactive
and/or animated plots created via `hypertools.plot` and
`hypertools.DataGeometry.plot`.  Main functionality is contained in
`set_interactive_backend` (front-end function) and `manage_backend`
(decorator/context manager for `hypertools.plot`).

Note that the interactive plotting backend is currently managed via a
module-scoped variable, and therefore this functionality isn't
thread-safe. However, since matplotlib itself isn't thread-safe either
(see https://matplotlib.org/faq/howto_faq.html#working-with-threads),
this isn't really a limiting problem and therefore probably okay.

    The issue is that we're passing these to a ton of different

    complex to try to trace through where they're passed as-is, plus
    any of these functions may be changed at any time, and subclasses
    of `UserString` fail type-checks for **actual** strings (i.e.,
    `isinstance(UserStringSubclass('a'), str)` returns False) whereas
    this approach doesn't. So this will (hopefully) be more stable

    Handles an annoying edge case in `init_backend()`:
      - IPython uses "greedy" TAB-completion, meaning code is actually
        executed in order to determine autocomplete suggestions
          + there is a config setting to disable this, but it's enabled
            by default
      - if TAB-completion is used in an import statement, the module is
        actually imported if it hasn't been previously [1], which means
        that for `hypertools`, `init_backend()` will be run
      - because the TAB-completion happens in a non-IPython subprocess,
        the backend will be initialized for non-notebook use.

    To correct this, the function:
      - looks through the stack trace for a call made from IPython's
        TAB-completion module (`IPython/core/completerlib.py`)
          + this is probably the safest way to do the search, since A)
            the module name is less likely to change than the function
            name or line number, and B) searching for *any* IPython
            module would break importing `hypertools` in an IPython shell
          + this is also probably the fastest way to search, since A) it
            short-circuits on the first call specific to this scenario,
            and B) the call stack will usually be at most a few imports
            deep in non-notebook environments
          + at minimum, the last 3 calls will always be from `hypertools`
            so they're skipped to save time
      - if it finds one, removes both `hypertools.plot` and
        `hypertools.plot.backend` (and also `numpy`) from `sys.modules`...
          + the `import` statement (`importlib.__import__()`) checks
            `sys.modules` for already-loaded modules before importing,
            so removing these causes them to be reloaded when the
            `import` command is actually run
          + both `hypertools.plot` and `hypertools.plot.backend` need to
            be removed to avoid using the cached call to `init_backend()`
          + `numpy` is also unloaded, otherwise its C extensions get
            confused when `hypertools` is re-imported and issue a whole
            slew of warnings
      - ...and raises a generic exception (handled in [1]), which skips
        running the rest of `init_backend()` while still allowing the
        TAB-completer to keep searching other `hypertools` modules
          + Also, since both of the removed modules will already have
            been seen by the completer at this point, they'll still be

    Parameters
    ----------
    backend : str
        the interactive matplotlib backend to switch to

    Notes
    -----
    1. `flush_figures` is a post-cell execution callback that
       `plt.show()`s & `plt.close()`s all figures created in a cell so
       that later `plt.plot()` calls create new figures. There's a weird
       circular matplotlib/IPython interaction where:
         - `matplotlib.pyplot` (via `IPython.core.pylabtools`) registers
            `flush_figures` when it's imported into an IPython
            environment
         - The `%matplotlib inline` magic command also registers a
           `flush_figures` call each it's run, whether or not one has
           been registered already
         - IPython runs `%matplotlib inline` if it detects
           `matplotlib.pyplot` has been imported and no backend is set
           in the same cell.
       So depending on import order, whether imports happen across
       multiple cells, and whether/when/how many times the backend has
       been switched, there may be any number of `flush_figures`
       callbacks registered. Switching to the interactive notebook
       backend unregisters one `flush_figures` callback but leaves the
       other(s), and creating an interactive figure with `flush_figures`
       registered closes the figure immediately after the cell executes
       and causes the matplotlib event loop to throw an error. So we
       need to ensure all `flush_figures` instances are unregistered
       before plotting.
    2. In certain situations, the IPython magic command fails to switch
       the backend but the matplotlib command will succeed. And for some
       unfathomable reason, when the magic command fails, IPython
       **prints** a warning message rather than issuing it via
       `warnings.warn()` [1]. So the only way to catch this warning is
       to temporarily suppress and capture stdout.

def _reset_backend_notebook(backend):
    """
    Handles resetting the matplotlib backend after displaying an
    animated/interactive plot in a Jupyter notebook by registering a
    "one-shot" self-destructing pre_cell_run callback to the next cell

    Parameters
    ----------
    backend : str
        the matplotlib backend prior to running `hypertools.plot`

    Notes
    -----
    Changing the matplotlib backend in a Jupyter notebook immediately
    closes any open figures (meaning animation and interactivity stop),
    so we can't do it as part of the function call or register it as a
    post-execution hook for the current cell. We get around this by
    registering a callback function that runs *before* the *next* cell
    is run, resets the backend, and unregisters itself. This way, the
    animation runs and the plot is interactive until the user runs the
    next cell, but the backend is reset before any code is executed. And
    because the callback "self-destructs," we won't force later figures
    to close unnecessarily ("changing" the backend to the current backend
    still does this) and doing this multiple times won't pollute the
    callback list, which can slow down cell execution.

    We also have to define and register the callback inside a wrapper
    function, since we need to reference the backend we're switching to
    using the same syntax as `matplotlib.pyplot.switch_backend`. IPython
    callbacks have to have the same signature as the prototype for the
    event they're registered to, and the pre_run_cell prototype takes no
    arguments. And since the callback needs to reference the correct
    function object in order to unregister itself, we can't just wrap it
    in `functools.partial`.

class set_interactive_backend:
    """
    Manually set the `matplotlib` backend used for generating
    interactive plots.

    Whereas `hypertools.plot`'s `mpl_backend` keyword argument can be
    used to specify the backend for a single plot,
    `hypertools.set_interactive_backend` is useful for doing so for
    multiple (or all) interactive plots at once, and can be in two
    different ways:

    1. directly, to change the backend for the for all subsequent
       interactive plots
          ```
          import hypertools as hyp
          geo = hyp.load('weights_avg')

          geo.plot(interactive=True)          # uses the default backend

          hyp.set_interactive_backend('TkAgg')
          geo.plot(interactive=True)          # uses the TkInter backend
          geo.plot(animate=True)              # uses the TkInter backend
          ```

    2. as a context manager with the `with` statement, to temporarily
       change the backend
          ```
          import hypertools as hyp
          geo = hyp.load('weights_avg')

          geo.plot(interactive=True)          # uses the default backend

          with hyp.set_interactive_backend('TkAgg'):
              geo.plot(interactive=True)      # uses the TkInter backend

          geo.plot(animate=True)              # uses the default backend
          ```

    Parameters
    ----------
    backend : str
        The `matplotlib` backend to use for interactive plots, either
        temporarily (when used as a context manager with `with`) or for
        the life of the interpreter (when called as a function)

    Notes
    -----
    1. `set_interactive_backend` is technically a class, but it
       shouldn't typically be used as one and is only designed this way
       to enable it to work as both a regular function and a context
       manager.
    2. When used as a context manager, the backend passed to
       `hypertools.set_interactive_backend` will be used for *all* plots
       created inside the context block, regardless of whether:
         - they are interactive/animated or static
         - the `mpl_backend` keyword argument is passed to
           `hypertools.plot`
         - they were created with `hypertools`, `matplotlib`, or a
           different `matplotlib`-based library (e.g., `seaborn`,
           `quail`, `umap-learn`)
       There are a few reasons for this behavior:
         - being able to skip inspecting the arguments passed to each
           `hypertools.plot` call means almost no overhead is added for
           calls after the first, and makes wrapping multiple calls much
           more efficient
         - the plotting backend is an attribute of `matplotlib` itself
           and `matplotlib` doesn't support running multiple backends
           simultaneously in the same namespace, so it's impossible to
           avoid it affecting other `matplotlib`-based plotting libraries
         - it's reasonable to assume this was the desired outcome when
           multiple plots are generated inside a context block, since A)
           the context block will always have been created manually by
           the user, and B) the API provides multiple other ways to set
           the backend without this effect
    3. The `manage_backend` decorator for `hypertools.plot` determines
       whether it's being called inside the
       `hypertools.set_interactive_backend` context manager by checking
       the value of a global variable (`IN_SET_CONTEXT`), which is
       switched to `True` when the the runtime context is entered and
       `False` when it's exited. This definitely isn't an ideal setup
       and could probably be refactored out in the v2.0 overhaul, but
       for now the alternatives are A) using something like
       `inspect.getframeinfo` or `traceback.extract_stack` to look for
       the context manager every time `hypertools.plot` is called, or B)
       re-running the same runtime argument checks every time, either of
       which would be much less efficient. So for now, the current setup
       is probably good enough.
