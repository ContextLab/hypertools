    Given multi-subject data, factorize it as a shared response R among all
    subjects, an orthogonal transform W per subject, and an individual
    (outlying) sparse component S per subject:
    .. math:: X_i \\approx W_i R + S_i, \\forall i=1 \\dots N
    This unsupervised model allows to learn idiosyncratic information for
    subjects and simultaneously improve the shared response estimation.
    The model has similar properties to the Shared Response Model (SRM) with
    the addition of the individual components.
    The model is estimated solving the following optimization problem:
    .. math::
        \\min_{W_i, S_i, R}\\sum_i \\frac{1}{2}\\|X_i - W_i R - S_i\\|_F^2
    .. math:: + \\gamma\\|S_i\\|_1
    .. math:: s.t. \\qquad W_i^TW_i = I \\quad \\forall i=1 \\dots N
    The solution to this problem is obtained by applying a Block-Coordinate
    Descent procedure. More details can be found in [Turek2017]_.

        Number of features to compute.
    gamma : float, default: 1.0
        Regularization parameter for the sparseness of the individual
        components. Higher values yield sparser individual components.
    rand_seed : int, default: 0
        Seed for initializing the random number generator.
    Attributes
    ----------
    w_ : list of array, element i has shape=[voxels_i, features]
