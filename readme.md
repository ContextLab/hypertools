"_To deal with hyper-planes in a 14 dimensional space, visualize a 3D space and say 'fourteen' very loudly.  Everyone does it._" - Geoff Hinton

## Overview

HyperTools is designed to facilitate
[dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction)-based
visual explorations of high-dimensional data.  The basic pipeline is
to feed in a high-dimensional dataset (or a series of high-dimensional
datasets) and, in a single function call, reduce the dimensionality of
the dataset(s) and create a plot.  The package is built atop many
familiar friends, including [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/),
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) and
[seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).  Our package was recently
featured on
[Kaggle's No Free Hunch blog](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/04/10/exploring-the-structure-of-high-dimensional-data-with-hypertools-in-kaggle-kernels/).  For a general overview, you may find [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb_ER9RGtOM) useful (given as part of the [MIND Summer School](https://summer-mind.github.io) at Dartmouth).

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/contextlab/hypertools-paper-notebooks)

or

Check the [repo](https://github.com/ContextLab/hypertools-paper-notebooks) of Jupyter notebooks from the HyperTools [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08290).

## Installation

To install the latest stable version run:

`pip install hypertools`

To install the latest unstable version directly from GitHub, run:

`pip install -U git+https://github.com/ContextLab/hypertools.git`

Or alternatively, clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/ContextLab/hypertools.git`

Then, navigate to the folder and type:

`pip install -e .`

(These instructions assume that you have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) installed on your system)

NOTE: If you have been using the development version of 0.5.0, please clear your
data cache (/Users/yourusername/hypertools_data).

## Requirements

+ python 2.7, 3.5+
+ PPCA>=0.0.2
+ scikit-learn>=0.18.1
+ pandas>=0.18.0
+ seaborn>=0.8.1
+ matplotlib>=1.5.1
+ scipy>=0.17.1
+ numpy>=1.10.4
+ future
+ requests
+ deepdish
+ pytest (for development)
+ ffmpeg (for saving animations)

If installing from github (instead of pip), you must also install the requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error related to installing deepdish (hdf5) on a MacOS system, try installing hdf5 directly using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```
$ brew tap homebrew/science
$ brew install hdf5
```
and then re-start the installation.
